it a great product but don want to buy again because it was stolen its sound quality makes people steal it so disappointed to lose my lovely dabba 
i received this product today it chota packet bada dhamaka awesome product in this prize range didn used it fully so don know about the battery life
fantastic speaker for this price just lacks that bass thump otherwise very very good audio output it gets very loud fills small to mid sized room easily no distortion on the high audio level vocals and mids are clear and overall very nice audio experience
nice product sound quality is good easy to carry anywhere coz of the small size but if listen to songs whole day then have to charge it times for me it best 
sound quality is just awesome long battery life bluetooth connection fast portable build quality is very good
a very good package for the small footprint it has however feel portronics soundpot has louder audio output while maintaining good bass and crisp treble this one is excellent in isolation and won let you complain but you can try the other one also 
would strongly recommend to anyone intending to buy bluetooth speaker great sound quality connects easily through bluetooth and has good battery back up bought it after experiencing it at my cousin place comes in vibrant colours as an additional feature 
very good quality product worth buying it compact size and sound quality is good in comparison to other wireless portable speakers sound is sufficient for room bass is little less in comparison to home theatres but yet good and one more thing the battery backup is really good over all good product 
the sound is less if more people have to hear but otherwise good product it is very sturdy 
the jbl go that bought in sale is great purchase for my laptop has low volume due to which use these speakers and their quality is also very smooth 
this is the best product bought in while gifted this to my mother and she is very happy very good sound quality compatible size good battery life happy with the purchase just buy it if you want voice treat or give it as present to your loved ones they will love it guarantee don confuse just go for it 
got the product within working days nice bass and good sound also it original product have got it registered from jbl india official site 
awesome sound quality is great once charged it will work for to hrs continuously my frds also purchased the same product they are also happy with this product worth as per price 
awesome little sound machine it perfect for contemporary times however the charger could be improved on not as easy to use as the speaker itself 
excellent voice clarity for listening songs during evening relaxation hours pleasant moods developed given the advantage of using the product in our private space 
only drawback can see in this product is its too small comparing to the images shown in amazon good sound quality and enough to fill room bluetooth speaker phone aux in mic all in box it would be wounderful if it have an usb port also overall excellent product
i am writing this review after month of use it is very good product excellent sound quality and over all performance month before had bought portronics por sounddrum bluetooth stereo speaker but am more satisfied on jbl go recommend jbl go for quality sound lovers jbl go loundness is also very good 
it absolutely wonderful the sound quality is great connectivity is also good battery back is great but go for the latest model jbl go plus it has inbuilt google assistant it costs less as well around

the speaker quality is good compact and ya always jbl quality little smaller than thought but it great was gift for my sis and she loved it

a small companion for your short trips can easily be carried in your pocket like it crisp sound long battery backup and portability will highly recommend the product if you are looking for tiny yet powerful and affordable bluetooth speaker 
a good buy its ideal for single person specially for travelling and outdoor parties base is good followed by good battery life good product by jbl harman 
excellent product for the price and the battery holds up pretty well for long listening sessions perfect for people who aren expecting phenomenal sound quality but just want nice flashy budget indoor bluetooth speaker unfortunately the white jbl logo does fade over time but that a very minor nitpick and it to be expected overall definitely recommend it 
love my jbl which bought back music into life my kitchen and meditation times are more enjoyable because of it do carry it for my car small gettogethers daughters dance practices etc few improvements that wish would be mic quality battery life fm and size for the value 
well it all about knowing what you want generally m not into head phones and my laptop inbuilt speakers aren really what want them to be the jbl portable speaker allows me to play music in superior quality with highly filtered sounds trust that it louder than its seems base is good too suitable for moderately big room choose quality 
it is really great product with crisp and clear sound quality bass is moderate and vocals are awesome connectivity is very simple and easy the mic also has good calling quality the only problem is battery runtime which is very less compared to other speakers in this price range 
great wireless bluetooth speakers performance equal to xiaomi speakers which are rupees cheaper 
the speakers were fabulous better than expectations they re tiny can fit in the palm of your hand and lightweight so its easy to take them anywhere and use them with any device having bluetooth compatibility the sound quality is wonderful although there is no bass boost or subwoofer all in all great package at 
it has good sound quality is very small handy useful for senior citizens who would need louder volume of sound to listen to music 
my experience with jbl and also cloudtail is very good got fresh and genuine piece of jbl go material quality use in body is quite nice sound quality also above cloudtail work genuinely expectations
excellent product from jbl really loved it connectivity pros bluetooth version make the connectivity very easy fast cons there is no password facility so it may bother to someone who love to personalize the things for me it not an issue other options for connectivity it has aux input and mic which allows you to speak through the mic when attend phone call portability it a portable speaker made for music lovers it very compact and light weight so very easy to port it anywhere and enjoy the music sound quality the sound quality of the speaker is excellent it base is able to full room completely it only w rms but sound output is fantastic color options ordered teal color it also available in different colors which are following teal yellow pink blue grey orange red black so nobody will be dissatisfied as there are many color variants choose the one which you love battery performance lithium ion polymer v mah battery is slightly weaker than other famous brands like bose amazon basic but it not big difference it gives up to hours battery backup with full volume it sufficient other brands give up to hours battery back with full volume so it not big difference until it matters to you best thing it takes only hours to charge it fully pricing price is genuine as per the quality other brands are also in the same price range so price is competitive finally can say it a must buy product 
it is very good product sound quality is good as well as bluetooth connectivity use the product while am driving my car for good connectivity with my mobile no need to touch my mobile just press the button on the product ashim jyoti 
sound is mind blowing battery backup and connectivity is outstanding jbl is history and making future more stable in their products surely
jbl oh my love this cute sound bomb is just awesome it let my music to stay with me forever durable design fantastic sound quality great battery life you will certainly satisfied with this music box works flawlessly with my op charge once in week infact this product made me to buy jbl endurance dive 
it a great product small and light and at first glance thought it be an okay product and the sound wouldn be loud enough but was wrong it goes very loud without any distortion the only thing is there is no surround effect and that pretty obvious but not big deal for me love it 
only used sony headsets and speakers jbl changed my trend this speaker is awesome as far as the sound bass is concerned it was real surprise can yet comment on the battery back up as of now just started using it today portability is of course fine goes into your pocket easily build quality is excellent it water resistant material pairing was child play usb cable which come with it is guess too small but overall the product at this price range is worth it 
for a single room its really great product while working on laptop you can listen music or while workout you can play music sound quality is really good only problem see if you connect to android phone and then if you try to connect it with your laptop even its not connected to phone but paired with phone it will not connect cause you have to unpair it first from mobile device and vice versa 
less charging time very good back up killer look very handy very responsive nice range and above all mind blowing sound crystal clear but be aware once when visited jbl service centre at rajendra place new delhi they didn entertain online purchased product just refused straightforwardly whats that 
it nice about it sounds it awesome and battery life it is nice but when ever we using in higher sound the battery life it couldn be stable for hours it will be maximize atleast hr or hr but iam truly satisfied with jbl go thankyou jbl
awesome speaker small yet powerful and clear please don expect great bass from it it not meant that for delivering good bass it palm sized and it does the job very well it a bit old now and there lot of new better small portable speakers available however for the price there is nothing to beat it 
guys the most amazing feature is when your bluetooth is connected to the jbl the input jack becomes an output jack ie you can connect it to ur bigger system hats off
excellent product very loud and clear sound have logitech x also which is maybe little louder but the sound on this is very clear and nice after purchasing this dont like using x 
an honest review ahead got my jbl delivered yesterday and thought of doing battery test first was amazed by it using it on vol and getting decent bass it went whopping hours straight and gets fully charged in hours only am very happy with this thanks jbl and amazon for such great deal 
easy to use smooth finish sound quality is good and decent battery life overall good buy though not much support provided by the website regarding warranty 
if you are looking for speaker with usability for one person or one room go for it jbl has always been delivering me it quality and no wonder this time too the bass and treble both are balanced sound quality is optimum for variety of genere eg rock classical old pop etc 
absolutely fantastic speaker from jbl use it on my office desk and it creates good quality music the pairing of the speaker with the phone is really simple and quick the battery lasts for solid couple of hours you cannot find better speaker at this price 
i tried out portable speakers jbl go portable bluetooth waterproof speaker black bluetooth speaker lfs wireless speaker portable loud stereo sound w rich bass ft bluetooth range mp mini speaker bluetooth speaker portable mini bluetooth speaker superior clarity and enhanced heavy bass powerful big sound driver ft wireless range up to hours playtime premium wireless bluetooth speak by rock space muveacoustics portable bluetooth speaker loudest wireless stereo sound for home and travel blue oontz angle new enhanced edition portable bluetooth speaker with ft wireless range volume booster amp watts power custom bass radiator crystal clear stereo sound ipx splashproof amazonbasics portable wireless bluetooth speaker black tried them all out for sound quality and the better sounding ones were in rough order from best to least impressive the oontz the rock space the jbl and kinda surprisingly the amazonbasics the sound quality on the lfs was acceptable but not nearly as good as the others and the muve sounded like crap did not compare them in terms of battery time and haven had them long enough to comment on their durability happy listening so if this review helped you please vote it helpful 
it is small wonder big surprise in small box sound quality is awesome connects very easily with multiple devices battery life is also very good completely portable can be fit in jeans pocket 
i amazed by the quality of sound this small device produces the base is slightly higher to my taste would have rated it better if it had an onboard radio next previous buttons but for these this is an amazing product 
probably the best speaker you can get at this price sound quality is good and loudness is appropriate it so small and portable that it can be put in your pocket bluetooth connectivity and range is also good overall if anyone needs decent speakers at this rate then it the best
jbl naam hi kafi hai hai well coming to the speaker small compact size with crystal sound and decent bass will recommend you guys 
trust me just went nuts to buy bluetooth speaker and finally after lot of surfing and suggestions had to turn up for jbl and swear it dint disappoint me the sound is jus fab and this product has good bass sound dint find any kind of crackling sound when tuned up to high volume so at this rate if you are luking for good speaker with all the necessary features please dont beat around the bush just buy this product blankly this is worth every penny 
very good product there is no lagging streaming is continuous and clear very good sound quality in low volume not so good in high volume it very handy and cute go for it friends 
the sound is good would however say little more clarity of sound would be better but in no means it is bad battery life is pretty good material is good sound is also good 
best product have ever purchased in amazone good built quality sound is awesome better for small rooms cars etc very durable 
really amazing product in this price value for money recieved within hours in standard prime delivery packaging was good intact only drawback is that it comes with very short data cable to charge it it is really difficult to charge it with that cable but can use your standard phone charger for charging purpose 
people around go crazy wondering where audio with such quality and volume comes from been using for months and the experience is an absolute bliss everytime decent bass very good audio quality even when maxxing out battery lasts more than you would want it to pocket friendly connectivity is just tap away solid build quality scratch proof would say not waterproof design although it did survive few splashes couple of times price isnt competitive get it in sale dual color led wish it had rgb 
it a good buy would recommend everyone to buy this even my friends have it and it clear and good sound with bass tried it in my gym and all liked it the sound is too loud even in bigger location room loved it
the speaker colour is really attractive and as per it size it is loud enough to be used in closed environment rather than in an open setting 
bought this for and have to say it packs quite punch for the size range is great no connection drop issues good base you can easily put it in the pocket of your jacket or bag sound cracks bit above volume apart from that it a great speaker material used is of good quality 
i have been using this speaker since last months and it is really working good with perfect sound quality

go for this speaker without any second thoughts it has been more than year since bought this and there have been no issues with the speaker so far the sound quality is excellent the bass effect is commendable and the battery lasts quite long as well in terms of look and feel the product is quite sturdy too 
i bought this jbl speaker for my laptop since my laptop sound is low speaker is good but cant increase the sound limit ex video has normal sound means that sound volume plays in jbl cant increase the sound can increase the sound when have more sound volume in ur video have attached the video first without the fan sound later with the fan noise sound can find the difference songs are having good sound but watch more movies and course want to more sound few days later found solution my laptop has problem in connecting the speaker so used aux cable now can use it try guys works like gem 
i think have or of them love it bluetooth functions are way powerful than even bose sound touch 
excellent sound lasted nearly hours great looks and good clear concise output 
awesome speaker for personal room and portability sounds good with good bass and sound quality design is tough and rubber finish makes it resistant to scratches and smudges overall very good experience buying it enjoying the product 
a must buy amazing sound great buy for buy it during the sale it would be the best purchase it fits in your pocket battery lasts for lonnnnnnng time doesn take long time to charge really amazing buy 
i got it for rs during sale and for the price the sound m getting surprised me it actually quite loud if you re going to use it casually for music on the go or even to use the mic that comes with this device to speak to someone on the phone it great looks and feels quite premium too can find single negative about this product so far have been using it for week clarity and bass are decent mean it not going to beat your dedicated expensive stereo home theater any day but for the size and price the utility this offers is well worth it 
amazing product at that price it is loud and has amazing quality recommend this purchase con might be that connecting this to laptop has been troublesome doesn stay connected for long time
perfect combination of sound quality and portability the sound bleeds very slightly at max volume but its still good
loved this product anyone looking for good portable speaker which can make listen to music anywhere any time with good sound can go for this product 
very convenient to carry best sound clarity every beat comes clearly can be used for parties too the out side material is kind of rubber it protects the device from accidents damages just go for it you will love it 
satisfied with the product excellent fit and finish clear and loud enough sound for sq ft house easily connects to bluetooth
great quality output good bass for its size seamless connection to mobile amazing battery life don charge it for week sometimes
it is an exceptional speaker for its size the only problem is there is less bass but all in all very handy and quality product 
i am writing this review after using it more than six months awesome product nice quality full charged battery may run upto hrs
i bought it for my laptop and mobile good sound quality and more than enough volume for one room user battery life is more than hours as jbl mentioned but comparatively low backup than competitives or other brands at same prize good value for money 
well built speakers very handy can carry in your pocket nice audio output giving it stars because at this price range more economical products are available 
this product is small but it has great power in its sound material quality is good and weighs in mid range according to the size sound quality is damn amazing hearing this was amazed looking at the size but such great power works really well 
hey if you are looking for good sound quality bluetooth speaker withing rs to rs then trust me don read reviews just go for it am using it for nearly year its best for its price it has good built quality its even compact so its easy to carry even though its size is small but its sound is just amazing it even has good battery life thank you jbl for this product its just awesome 
i used this product years ago then lost it in move decided to replace it with another bluetooth speaker in the same range because wanted to try something different that is when learnt all that can possibly go wrong with device of this size and functionality had taken the goodness for granted with jbl go the fact that its bluetooth connectivity is flawless that there this tiny beep that lets you know when it connected that there this light that blinks when it searching that the battery lasts ages and that the sound performance is out of this world it fills the room it performs at maximum sound and it delivers happiness am back with my ex bluetooth speaker and m never going exploring again unless it for really high end product ve never owned one thank you jbl for this understated glorious piece of perfection so much respect for your brand 
the battery life is very good and so is the bluetooth distance you get the speakers usb cable and the manual in the box cloudtail is the best seller for this product bought the product for rs specs battery charge time hours mah speakers playback time hours pros on time and and proper delivery reliable product quality battery life and sound clarity stylish product call receive and reply when phone is connected clarity is appreciable cons small distortion at high volume low power and audio output short usb cable
it can charge and play at the same time it is huge bomb in tiny size just make sure not to play in full volume if you are under an unstable roof edit recently my friend got boat stone it is so much better than jbl go jbl has upper hand is its compact size and lightweight but in the end personally like the crisp sound in jbl go edit am just loving it now use it with my laptop running ubuntu few minutes back was playing movie in vlc and when clicked the hangup button the movie paused 
look away if you like thumping bass this is great speaker if you like normal bass with accurate sound built solidly cons are no sd card slot and battery life isn that great logitech xs has better battery got this at on sale so am pleased 
great speaker value for money nice clear voice ordering another one now for small room go is fine no need to get flip 
the thing is until you do not have these speakers you would think your laptop speakers are okay and would do the job but as soon as you use these regularly you will hate your laptop speakers bass is tight enough for the price and punchy mids are clear and precise highs are detailed but loses integrity at higher volumes there is bit of distortion on the highest and step below that but who listens that loud connectivity is decent and can connect seamlessly upto meters without any wall glass in between battery life is great and can last for around to hours on single charge there is no better bluetooth speaker at this price range totally recommended 
awesome quick dilevery by amazon very easy to carry fits in my jeans pocket as well small in suze but sound is enough to part quality need not to be asked about as the name jbl is itself enough must go fot it 
i got it literally rs on amazon prime day awesome sound quality in this mini powerbox lovet it very much portable inch by inch but if you are thinking for room party choose speaker with more rms 
you can ask for more under k amazing speakers from jbl got mine in teal blue looks damn good and sounds damn good charge stays for pretty long as well 
very nice product sound is terrific loved the pink colour it portable and very light product but sound is very good thank you amazon for such great product in this price pls go for it so happy regularly listening this 
nothing more to add than what is already said in the reviews yes it an excellent device compact with solid performance great sound great bass and is an all round performer will not disappoint in spite of its tiny size must have 
jbl is the best within range previously bought philips bt though it costed me much lesser price less was not satisfied with it appearance sound quality and power as suggested by my friends all these three qualities found in this product no drawbacks found yet 
love it easy to connect it plays awesome using it for more than year now no issues it is my holiday must have too fits in ur purse 
amazing buy runs hours on battery easily for speaker much smaller than your palm it has very clear and loud sound highly satisfied with this product also mentioning that bought during festival sale for inr dunno what the current rate and so the current value for money would be 
i really didn expect to get such good product but has nice sound quality and all only thing is that it need to be charged for longer time but the rest is really nice 
bought initially for music and now used in my office for conferencing sheerly due to its easy of use clarity and volume this is mini monster of sound no compromise on bass its just perfect for my early morning workouts 
for the first time shipping was slow product received as shown in the picture quality product of jbl it is just too loud for such small size was surprised to hear it with such capability of playing all high and low notes of music so clean bass was too good overall wonderfull experience with jbl go 
just one word excellent good sound quality for portable speaker handy and fits in your palms but sounds like professional speaker while listening very much value for the money spent attending calls through this speaker is also an awesome experiance will strongly recommend to go for this jbl go 
wonderful output enough for party hall for its super deal thanks for sending neat packed no damage piece and color ordered for 
my first product was faulty one made replace request and finally got the working product speaker has very clear sound and louder as compare to its size have little bit good bass also outside rubber finish fills great in hand chargeing is also quick package should have included aux cable

nice product bought it for rs in amazon great indian festival sound quality material quality is too good battery back up is also good enough but better the price could be even more two or three hundred rupees lesser
excellent output for the size of the product looks are not that great 
i have been using this speaker for the last months and overall this product is value for money material quality nice sound loved it battery pretty good not that great 
have been using it over an year portable and compact bluetooth speaker and neat and best one you can find in this price range sound quality is not complainable at all it gets charged up quickly and the power lasts pretty well too good buy 
very nice compact powerhouse good for your own bedroom or if you want to carry it somewhere for trip or picnic since it is compact built quality is very good thanks for delivering it on time amazon 
this is my second purchase of this bluetooth speaker amazing value for money battery life clarity ease of connecting all ten on ten the range could have been larger but doesn really affect my application 
volume is not so loud but best for listing music watching movies sound quality is excellent 
really fantastic amazing and crystal clear crisp sound price is little bit on higher side but keeping in view of its sound quality it is worth buying am writing this review after using it for while 
though the product is small it produces sound of extreme quality it can easily cover up rooms due to its small size you can take it anywhere and its battery is excellent played it continuously for hrs excellent product highly recommended portable product 
thanks to amazon for safe and one day advanced delivery of this tiny but terrific bluetooth sound speaker am using this tiny bluetooth speaker in my clinic chamber it having great sound am happy with this product
i loved the product its small and compact yet very powerful the sound is loud at max volume yet very clear it perfect to watch movie on your laptop at home or to carry in bag while travelling very impressed it proved to be better than my expectations 
superb sound quality minimizes little when in high volume but it is sufficient for my purpose of small room and price is in budget super sound quality battery backup color compact features in love 
best in audio effect battery back up good up to hrs at max volume purchased at offer prise rs used days from received and advice to buyer go without nd thought 
this is the best speaker for such cheap price cant believe it would sound so good if you are looking for something cheap and something that still sounds good wouldn say amazing but its clear loud and has great sound 
i really love this blue tooth speaker ve had it for months now and everything is going well
awesome product worth purchasing it really very compact easy to handle drawback is that the usb cable is very small would suggest that check the seller before you buy it matters
very good sound quality and surprisingly powerful bass connects well via bluetooth with both android and apple devices 
this is very good product just close your eyes and buy it it is equipped with very nice microphone when used it the other party did not even realise that was using it this is very cool stylish compact and lightweight the only drawback is its volume it is loud but not very very loud 
this is awsome sound bomb for its size the sound it produces is stunning this my second speaker for my mom as she doesnt stay apart from my speaker most of the time definitely recommended 
sound quality is amazing even at full volume it is enough to fill big room of ft not recommended for outside battery backup is also good will recommend buying it
i don know about other speakers but what is this speaker sound quality oh my god can believe such small one performing like anything had purchased one for myself after that am continuously purchasing and gifting to everyone close your eyes and order it you will never regret best speaker in the world in this budget purchase only satisfactory product in which this is is also placed 
quite favourite at our home this little guy follows us around when we need some music from the kitchen to the garden it sound quality is very acceptable for its size and portability good purchase overall now let see how long it lasts 
the product is awesome it have good sound quality as well as bluetooth connectivity have only one issue regarding the payment of the product have paid the amount by bhim upi which includes cashback within one month but still haven received any cashback kindly request you to please look into the matter and provide me my cashback if possible thank you
perfect bluetooth speaker that is amazingly loud bass both base and treble are extremely good high quality music quality amazingly amazing aux included no but it has such good bluetooth power which does not ned aux 
this speaker is really amazing loud crisp sound good battery life its mic and every feature is working fine wished it had big charging wire which is too small overall its fantastic product one must buy 
honest review after week long used it sound is superb and call answering is perfect but only worried is sometimes it get disconnected don know it my phone fault or speaker overall it very good speaker in tangy orange colour
a perfect speaker with soothing music clarity not much loud not much low best use in travelling full charging time is hr battery life is hrs in medium volume if go for high thn its hrs nd yes it is worth buying for me my experience is good with this gadget point is that you can connect big music box or dj speakers too via aux cable 
the sound it produces is remarkably and surprisingly loud compared with the size though it does not produce the quality bass effects but considering the size the sound quality is crystal clear the battery output is good as it last for around to hours which is more than satisfactory if you want to listen to the music on your laptop or on the mobile this product will surely exceed your expectation 
love it great bass sound quality when used indoors not sure if it will deliver the same quality outdoors ordered the black one product does look great 
don think about it very much it is superb great and lots more product im really really satisfied after buying this speaker awesome sound quality also ordered nd one for my brother buy this at rs which is the cheapest think grab it 
it is one of the best product have ever seen am using it for the last months it is helping me lot in my work thanks jbl and amazon team
first of all when you will buy this you will feel awesome product and it is awesome but the problem you will face is that after six month the sound of the speaker will goes on tearing when you will increase the volume and overall the product is good the bluetooth strength is awesome beyond expectation and it works like alexa anytime anywhere the matte finish on the rubber finish is awesome and will last forever am personally using it from month and what experience feel have written over here the battery life is good at last two hour of non stop music playing 
the best bluetooth speaker sound box though prefer not to buy chinese products but in electronics r hardly left with much options and this one is the best bought easy to use can carry anywhere and sound is just pleasant 
its very nice product awesome sound for product within this range jbl is any which ways brand gifted this one to my relative who really liked it plan to buy more in future 
material quality of the product is awesome tbh didn thought it would work in such way it absolutely value for money product sound is not that good but ya when you compare to its price it dope you can easily use it up to hrs continuously 
yes absolutely clear sound and bass values are equal in jbl go bluetooth must worth of purchasing but better go with advanced versions of jbl bluetooth speakers those who want high bass and high sound quality thumbs up 
amazing sound quality very light in weight and easy to carry anywhere absolutely loved the product only negative point is that it works only for hours in single charge else performance will exceed expectation 
good speaker for the price though use it infrequently but it performs well retains charge over period it is light and easy to carry
best portable bluetooth speaker you can never go wrong with jbl speakers and head phones the sound quality is awesome and bluetooth reception is also very good 
wo wo wo product really jbl keeps its promises jbl is one of the great kings of the sound world this bluetooth speaker is really worthy to cost 
this is little boom box it has decent projection and an amazing sound quality good for indoors outdoors the volume might seem underwhelming again the volume as per its size is amazing 
meets my expectation if corners were slightly rounded it would have been easier to carry catches signals from long distance decent material sound quality is good bass seems to be on the lower side good travel companion no doubt 
good original product quick delivery working fine good sound for the size of speaker its better than jbl micro ii wired in terms of connectivity 
jbl as the brand suggests is quite good product played it continuously for hours without charging the sound quality is good too good buy in all edit after years of usage it is still going strong and playing too good 
ultimate sound best for those who travel and love music worth buy as compare to other brands you won get this quality of sound in other bluetooth speaker after using around months am facing its automatic shutdown problem when played in full sound o vlc use connecting through mobile 
great speaker connects easily battery life is more than hours and sound quality is very good happy with the purchase 
after using months am writing this review build quality is pretty good and impressive but battery life is little low compared to different types of brands of same price except battery life product is impressive go for it
jbl means quality and clarity it sounds good compact size battery last for long value for money room filling sound without any distortion durability good for on the go 
very good and durable writing this review after somany months of usage before purchased some other bluetooth speakers and that all dead within months now am happy with this product 
everyone should have given this five stars maybe some got faulty speaker or something or maybe some people don know anything about speakers and set their expectations too high this is watt speaker it is full watt more powerful than the standard portable bluetooth speakers and it definitely is full watt more powerful than my other high quality watt speakers the sound is also fuller because it is stereo standard travel speakers are usually mono it is also loud so bottom like is that for little travel buddy this speaker kicks ass have never been so much happier with speaker before truly just get it if you get faulty one return it and get the same thing again and do it again if you have to because you simply must have this speaker if you want little travel speaker with big heart ve been using it daily for over year now and full charge still lasts for hours of course it depends on the volume how you treat the battery etc but very happy oh and this speaker has microphone too so you can do full phone calls video calls etc which is nice other travel speakers do not have microphone so you can do speaker calls and the other person voice will come through the speaker but they will only hear you if you are close to your phone anyway this can be useful anyway thanks for reading and please click helpful below thanks 
very good speaker for its size bass is on the lower size but the sound clarity is good sound starts to crack above prefer to play at mid volume which is good for small room battery life is also surprisingly good played music mins everyday and it lasted me an entire week for single charge got it for satisfied with the product 
i love jbl that it came home to me and it was definitely sane choice buying this unlike photronics whose service revert and product are pathetic jbl go is genius speaker with good quality sound and pretty funky pink color thanks jbl
i try many portable wireless speakers but this is great for personal user pro light weight compact size look attractive con not great bass in full volume sounds quality not great 
chota packet bada dhamaka superb speaker couldn believe such small speaker can have such loud and clear sound love it 
wow jbl kept the promise just amazed by the sound had zook speaker previously but this one is out of the crowd actually ordered two one for my friend 
i was looking for portable speaker with no great expectations bought the jbl go because well its jbl and price was also ok during lightning deal got the pink colour and it is super cute the speaker feels sturdy with premium built sound is quite good considering its tiny size bass is great it works better with bluetooth as its sound really gets affected when connected with aux cable don know if that the general problem with this product or just the unit received otherwise m very satisfied and using it all the time 
truth be told m not much of techie person so if you re looking for really professional review using big terms and are looking for an opinion about this product in techie point of view don read this review however what review ll give you is my honest opinion on the product in normal persons point of view the sound quality of the speaker is excellent maybe not as good as bose or something like that but if you re looking for speaker for purposes varying from chilling with friends during sleepover or simple dance rehearsal then highly recommend this it is also very very light weight and easy to carry around for one have carried this in my pocket the colour ordered the hot pink one is bright and great if you want to make statement so if you leave it somewhere and forget about it someone will probably call you up and will also probably return it back to you because the pink is attractive and they ve noticed it or they might not you know they might just take it for themselves who knows so if you re looking for speaker to begin with then go for it buy it you ll love it 
working fine even after year sound is still good average bass but good sound quality 
i have always been satisfied customer of amazon and this time as well to describe in just one word jbl go wireless bluetooth speaker is more than perfect the matierial is of good quality the soumd needs no explanation because it just awesome and nailing increase the sound from your mobile phone and just experience the incredibly flawless base of the speaker must say it will make your heart fly because the sound plays so well thank you 
well its been year since bought it it works like charm highly recommend it note dont go with the size ll suprised with the loudness clarity of sound 
i am writing this review after month of regular usage of jbl go as per the name it has very good base the sound quality is great it is enough for small living room for bday party for to members the battery is amazing can use it for hours with minimum volume and in high volume it hours cost wise it is bit pricey but can get long life 
it an awesome bluetooth speaker which doesn need testimony it stands itself in the crowd after using years m writing this review sound quality is good sufficient to accommodate people in living room in quite surroundings user friendly portable easy connectivity long battery life for hours when bought it was rs but now the price is little lower and affordable over all it worth buying it 
a very good product just go by my word this is very good bluetooth speaker never ever faced single problem with this product in connectivity or sound bass everything is good for this price bluetooth speaker reasonable price for gift or for yourself 
i liked the product it really good as per my use it depends on individual usage handling of the product 
if he instruction manual would have been big enough it would be better had to go through demo on you tube to start using the speaker once started it brought smile on mine and family members face thanks fits into your pocket carry to office and use it while commuting to office in busalong with my android smart phone even my office colleagues are happy thanks amazon jbl and seller
the product is worth the money spent during lightening deal jbl brand is super cool 
delivered on time all thanks to amazon prime service the product is great and sound quality is good too portable and beat come out great in such small music 
bought it as gift for friend but tested it as soon as it was delivered have the same one in black bought years ago and it still gives the same performance worth it 
superb little product it great to have such fantastic tiny speaker which absolutely does the job when it comes to call handling as well as audio output the elderly in my house were so happy to receive this awesome product by jbl 
it a small wonder speaker for to carry it wherever you wish to the music is not very loud but decent for small room environments it square box nature makes it one directional sound and not suitable for all around listening hope this review helps 
jbl makes some top notch portable speakers do not mistaken sound clarity with bass bought boat stone more bass than jbl but its sound started to crack within couple of days and though it was louder than this returned it this jbl is definitely most superior sounding in below k range the red color looks fantastic too 
sound quality is good even though its only wt but bass is low in full volume sound is not so smooth but overall value for money
its been yrs dont need anything else while being at my hostel room my jbl go singing in the background cup of instant coffe and book makes every sunday evng worth waiting for 
in one word its awesome it is beyond my expectation and am realy highly satisfied after getting this amazon delivery is so fadt received in just days after order if you find speaker that enhance your mobile or laptop sound it is better for that it worthy product 
nice product months have been passed working good no issue and lastly would definately recommand this little pocket friendly and travelling friendly product 
sound as ensured by the brand jbl expectations met high volume just as in car stereo worthy 
great sound don expect huge noise but really good picnic outings battery is also good
very nice product from jbl can carry anywhere sound quality is good bluetooth connectivity is fine sometimes creates problem connecting with my laptop but connects quickly with mobile phone portability is awesome because of its small and handy size 
i don whether received defective item or anything else clarity was top notch sound loudness was ok base was below my expectations but nothing to complain cause sound clarity was superb the issue was with me is occasionally its loudness was fluctuating goes up down
it may be awesome product if it have loud sound sound clearity is awesome build quility is also awesome bettery life is near about hours sound is not too loud compatable for small room
for such small size the sound is beyond expectations the clearity is great it is loud enough for big room no issues with connection for bluetooth as well as aux cable but as per my experience the sound quality is better when played on bluetooth one thing which gave me super surprise is that if tlyou use it as mic recorder to record your voice it works really fair interns of quality 
using this product almost daily the bluetooth connection is seamless it gets auto connect to your device effortlessly the sound quality is good not best but worth the price battery back up is good as well 
pretty loud sound for such small size and the price is also reasonable but there are also few cons like the sound clarity is not great and neither is the bass but if you don have any problem with these two you have win win situation pretty nice product at such price range would have given five star if the bass had been little more boosted up bluetooth connectivity is great but the company doesn mention the range but it is quite easy to connect some may have slight problem since the name cannot be changed due to its small size it can fit in palm and is highly portable 
my companion at last wherever go just love it am not headphone person so this is very suitable for my need good sound and lasting battery when recharged love it d
i say that if you have not decided yet please go ahead and buy it immediately this is actually the product that entertained me lot you may carry it while traveling battery backup is good if you play it with middle sound 
jbl go sound qulaity is best in the market its very handy and small size can fir comfortably in pocket overall nice product from jbl also its volume is enough to fill the room of sqft so its good for small kitty parties and other occasion

this portable speaker is just too good speaker is very handy and light in weight nice attractive color blue and very gripping surface the quality of sound very very clear feel happy for choosing this product it charges is very less time and lasts for quite long although dont have record of full time to charge and time for full discharge but the ratio is what matters and it is quite good 
battery life is short mostly use it with my laptop so can charge it all the time but cant use it anywhere else battery runs out very fast other than that good purchase sound quality is decent 
look jbl in this price range is giving good option no doubt material quality and surface finish is awesome sound is also good but for room and that too small but it suffices now coming to battery part charges fastly if have got turbo charger or fast charger but discharges also early personally think boat stone is awesome in all respects against this and that too at lower price rs in sale and boat stone is giving hrs playtime in real and awesome fast charge water proof solid design and what not and sound is awesommm
this speaker is small compact but packs punch with its clear loud sound the material is pleasant to handle and doesn get dirty easily the battery is as advertised the in built mic is of good quality because the person on the other side can clearly hear me even when there are numerous other background noise recommended buy and love it 
the sound quality is great bass is decent you will get best output in closed room battery output is good received in time and without any damages

bought on april works perfectly good sound quality bluetooth range is clear till about feet haven used it at more than that distance pricey for its size but worth the cost highly recommend neat packaging and speedy delivery too 
this speaker is simply one of the best things have bought on amazon it has full sound and easily fills up living room or small hall it defies its size and provides enough lower range of sound too it is compact the product finish has firm and yet soft feel to it the battery life is also pretty good very satisfied with this it comes at price that is worth for its quality and durability 
no need to say about jbl who knows the brand sound quality is very nice product is small have not used continously more than hour so can say how much time it will play overall good product 
volume or power of the sound is not up to the mark but according to the price it is well bluetooth connectivity is really good and it is easily portable also good battery life 
small in size great in sound and bass good in stand by time less in charging time easy to connect and finally regionable amount to buy it so am finally satisfied 
positives amazing sound quality when connected to phone devices it is enough for bhk flat where you can listen to music loud and clear with the speakers in the living room portable attractive design available in many colours to choose from affordable if you are music person and not looking to spend much for speakers negatives did not get good sound volume when connected to my laptop microsoft pro the sound volume reduced by so thats bit turn down for me overall liked the product 
i received the speaker just yesterday so this might be an unfortunate case of speaking too soon but really hope not superb product sound clarity wise volume wise mobility wise ease of use wise price wise it all just great works seamlessly with iphone didn have to consult the manual at all it was so easy to set it up to work with my phone if you are looking for wireless speakers with great everything well you have found it think no more go for it 
good product liked it think its the best product in this range compact light weight and easy to carry soundwise it good and look wise also its very cute 
nice deal good sound could have been bit cheaper 
the build quality is one of the best you wouldn find anything better built in this price range or higher for speaker of the same class the sound quality is super crisp vocals treble are excellent lacks little bass just little but overall quality is what you can expect from jbl battery life is good for regular use hrs day you ll have to recharge it once in days charges fast so that a plus point

still working good had purchased this product on jan e months
awesome product with awesome price its easy to carry nice sound battery charge in minutes last for hours this info is based on my own experience as am using it for past months continuously happy to have this
i must say that jbl has not compromised with the material quality in this wonderful product have kept aside me old wired speakers because after listening the songs from jbl go no one at home wants to use other speakers inside the home battery lasts full day without any hiccups wonderful product from jbl 
was not able to connect to bluetooth also found the package seal was opened and then re packed using cello tape hence got it replaced the second package received was properly sealed and there are no issues in connectivity awesome product great sound 
this is amazing sound clarity and level of volume in this range of products feel it even better than similar specs phillips speakers 
gifted this to my mother then to other family members all are very happy couple of other foamy members bought this after seeing my mother use it very easy to use build quality is very good has excellent touch and feel sound is also very clear and doesn distort at high volume best in class and budget
for that price would say am satisfied with the product the battery doesn run out so fast nor does it take long time to charge it love the color and love how compact the size is cos it can fit perfectly in my bag and can take it anywhere only wish the volume was little louder 
timely delivery by amazon as always excellent product with very good sound quality and clarity but have some apprehension that how will the company repair it if it ever god forbid need some repair since it has no nuts for opening the speaker and is fully sealed 
great quality and this is what we expect from jbl amazing sound quality from the tiny speaker much much much better than the laptop have lol thanks amazon for great deal go for it guys cheers 
awesom bluetooth speaker sound quality is pretty good was lucky enough to get it for just ie the best deal you can ever get for jbl go this is the second time am buying this pros build quality hassle free connection great connectivity sound quality portability cons battery is just hours wish this number was higher though you can always carry portable charger if you can get jbl go for or less then simply go for it if water proof feature is what you are after then you can go for jbl go next is jbl flip on my list 
the best thing ve purchased from amazon so far it fantastic you guys if you re thinking about buying this don think further buy it 
very awesome thing just love it always its so unpredictable so small but so awesome the sound quality is just superb and no one can expect such miracle at such price didnt do any research on this category of portable bluetooth speakers but can bet that you are never going to feel dissapointed after purchasing this one definitely you will be very happy after using it 
one of the best portable bluetooth speaker bought during amazon festival taken it allover india and it have proven it durability
this is the best found for the budget had sound quality is amazing for such low cost speaker battery life is good easy pairing and usage all in all recommend this speaker if you are looking for one 
it jbl by that it given that it gonna be awesome the size is juz perfect taking into consideration the size don expect the sound quality of boom box all from this but for the money you pay it worth it only small complaint the paint on the front grill tends to go off after while so be careful when you choose the colors 
best but price is high in great india sale its price is it is best price 
this is my nd jbl go purchase from amazon got one for myself and got another for my mom after she started asking one for herself it a good purchase at very good price 
this is great piece of equipment use in my car to listen to songs from mobile and it works well pick calls also using it but there it works just alright that not it core feature and it works great to listen to songs in your room as well 
review is shared after using the product for month overall performance of product is very good m very much satisfied with the product and and it qual of sound standby etc etc
this tiny mono speaker is good to listen soft music like classical melody pop when listing to rock music and bass boosted song it sounds flat the lows are not good build quality is good and connectivity has no problem its loud when playing at max volume the sound is clear even at high volume as this is mono speaker with mm driver will not get the woofing effects 
a worth it product gifted friend he found is really useful not good for big hall because bass is bit low sound clarity is awesome can be used for movie watching small party in house in hostels mic can be attached to the speaker code one and can act as loudspeaker 
it is unbelievable unless you see it and use it such small device about inch inch inch can produce such loud clear and high bass sound this is technological marvel have watt rms home theatre philips system watt rms logitech system watt rms fenda system this is only watt rms but sound output is fantastic and at this price point this is just steal it is so small that it will fit your palm or go inside your pocket but still produces amazing sound 
i personally feel its travellers product compact in size smaller than your palm so easy to operate good battery back up sufficient sound good in price bought it just week back its working well for me bet you wont be disappointed with this product 
its awesome good product very small but have loud and clear sound got just before two days of the delivery date connect very easily with any device and battery is too good to work very long time can connect with aux cable too 
great product though the sound isn that loud but plays really well from this compact yet powerful box it charges fast and am loving the colour 
i bought jbl go black one for my brother and one for myself from the same seller appario retail services pvt ltd and recieved original product both the time there are many cases where people were delivered with duplicate jbl go so registered both of my jbl go at the jbl official webisite under product registration and luckily they were original would reccomend you to buy from the above mentioned seller and the jbl signature sound is awesome love it 
what device seriously so much you guys will love this if ur trekker definatley will love it very cute small and sound quality is awesom easy to carry green colour is awesome and pleasant blue is too odd don buy it one of my friend has it even black whic is old and common
the best speaker have ever choosen from vide variety of products offered by jbl awesome portable speaker amazing sound speedy delivery from amazon handy sound quality is perfect in it crispiness strongly recommended to all 
this palm size device comes with excellent battery backup and very good connection of bluetooth frequency sound is pretty much clear 
awesome product deducting one star for little bit less bass than expected and battery life bit less than hours otherwise absolutely worth the purchase 
there is no substitute of this piece love this one if want to buy flip or ll suggest to only go for this its worth one 
one of the best product ever bought its for my wife as she takes dance classes and it very handy for her to carry it even 
strongly recommended to all great product clear sound good volume output the sound doesn crack at high volumes seemless bluetooth connectivity good for both music and hands free calls my family loves this product 
pros portable mini bluetooth speaker playtime of hrs after full charging amazing voice quality bass is perfect for the size infact better worth every penny you spend on it cons have not found any so far 
baap of all best sound jbl love you must have music is life 
very nice speakers love the sound the best past is its so compact can carry it around easily the buttons on top easy to press as well it was definitely good purchase 
purchased in and its compact speaker with great impact ideal for people who like to listen to music on high volume and at this price its the best 
the product is excellent when it comes to sound quality connectivity and portability in this range getting all three in one product is just amazing have been jbl user for very long time and can assure you that you will not regret buying this at all go ahead and buy it without any further doubts 
got the pink variant no that not gay and was struck by how much the colour popped when got it the blue light is nice contrast to the pink overalls jbl is tried and tested brand and this tiny speaker screams jbl on both its faces and also in the sound it produces sufficiently loud with good bass yes yes we played despacito electro swing that listen to is pretty taxing on speakers but this one seems to be taking it like champ battery life could ve been better but compromises have to made for speaker this small and priced so low we would all love tiny speaker with woofer like bass and battery that lasts all week but that not reality in the capitalist world we live in would buy again 
nice product pocket handy good sound sound levels are also perfect but think manufacturing company should work on battery section battery drains out so quick 
jbl go has amazing sound quality and its design and color is very nice and its bluetooth connectivity is very strong so it can connecting easily with other device by the bluetooth it is also can easily caring any other places as the product is small and light weighted over all am feeling comfortable with this product 
before buying had many doubts would speaker so cheap be any good is buying this from internet is good etc etc but sincerely saying jbl go is best in its own many ways dont need any eadphones while waching movie on my phone perfect companion for youtube while playing in decent size room with this price tag you cant ask anything and if still are not sure than spend times more than jbl go buy bose 
as expected its very nice product as per its sound and built quality both its feel touch is nice with rubber coated material sound is upto mark with its small size and loud clear sound love it
had thought in my mind that it would be larger than my palm but its teenie tiny really not expected so small really some small packet contains big blast impressed by its sound perfect bass and treble also battery life is more than hrs if played at normal hearing debicle db color is crunchy and poppy too and connectivity is fast 
very good and useful product 
very very useful and handy for music lovers
from the image thought it might be bigger but small enough to fit in your pocket its just an analogy however its shape would make you feel not to try this because it is not meant for keeping in packets packs good sound inside its small sized body with great quality bluetooth connectivity is amazingly fast clear voice communication over the call too through mic and output speaker can answer and hung up calls device is very responsive and over all performance and features makes it worth buying 
there is just no comparison to jbl the sound quality is brilliant compared to its size and it pretty loud too its size makes it very portable and the bluetooth connectivity never disappoints loved the portability 
really nice article and awesome sound quality worth buying product extremely happy with the article it can fit into the palm and easy to handle with big features 
i had buyed this speaker months ago and it sound is as same as the first time listened it makes the surrounding everywhere where you want to listen and it battery is superb it gives an amazing feeling to the listener like it very much and recommend it as your first speaker thanks to amazon 
this is good product but the sound quality not found to be great its easy to use and good connectivity not sure about the other things since got this week back
it is small but has good output there was no problem connecting to my devices works as advertised satisfied with the speaker 
great handy product made my life lively in and around the house the quality of sound is great am using it regularly for maths good buy it charges quickly and easily lasts hrs 
my experience one of the best speaker only for indoors not for outdoors bought this product at affordable price it a good bluetooth speaker works like charm connects seamlessly with my laptop and mobile phone sound quality is good the bass and loudness is average loudness in outdoor is below average definitely not recommended for outdoor use only buy this product if you are looking for budget bluetooth speaker and using it indoors products come with variety of plug in spot such as for mobile headphone and the speakers are very cool in looking no doubt about it and has mic in it overall experience with this is above average no problem and the product is reliable for listening musics at home 
in this price range it is good product must say easy to cary with and battery life and sound also good fact in sound its completable to big junbo speakers fel the bass is some wht average battery life some wht noted is max is to hr with full volume which is good but for easy cary so can go for it 
the quality as well as clarity of sound is perfect the device is small and very lightweight the performance is excellent for the price actually the best speakers below k doesn matter how small the product is it will boom your room with its sound and bass 
excellent in this price using it over two years it has become part and parcel of my years old daughter 
on the less expensive side of spectrum of the jbl products but delivery the same level of results works perfectly just minor issues with connectivity with bluetooth in few phones but works perfectly well with mine so happy customer 
nice small packet big sound easily covers one room and others too but good for room can call awesome too after all jbl 
this is an awesome product worth the price my friend has boat stone speaker and compared to that my jbl has better volume and clarity note use plus t phone and so it sounds even better compared to other phones within k didn try other phones

for its size it plays really loud sound quality is very good build and material quality is also good and does not feel cheap single charge lets you play for almost hours at volume so the battery life is also impressive note all above comments are considering the speaker size it can easily fit on your palm and can be an excellent companion while travelling 
thankyou for giving such wonderful product at my doorstep no day without jbl sound quality portability everything is excellent we use jbl frequently in this heavy rain enjoy lot my children use during their studies to improve the concentration hear meditational songs after they go it is my full time partner in the kitchen thankyou so much 
very good bluetooth speaker with superb sound easily fits in pocket for portability usb cable included for charging charge lasts an average period of time 
i was going to review after few months but it has impressed me just on first look recommended compact speaker if you get for or less perfect deal just go for it without thinking much 
the size surprised me it fits into palm looked bigger in the website page but for its price it a great speaker low on bass as expected but for its size the sound is crystal clear and wholesome 
value for money speaker sound quality is good lacks bit of bass though but that okay keeping in mind it size and price optimum for casual use would have given it stars for it performance but had to lower my expectations from this speaker keeping im mind the price if you want superior performance like for parties and if you could spare few bucks then would recommend buying jbl flip but in this price range it a decent speaker 
the edges and corners may be rounded for better looks and more importantly to prevent chance injury the bass response is not that good but then the size of the speaker is small the clarity of sound is excellent 
jbl harman known for quality and this product proved it again nice packing crisp conventional design and sound quality worth its price lacking in bass is the only concern but think in such small size and price what jbl is providing is worth its price would recommend to buy this and only this as compared to other hell lot of similar available on the shelf missing fifth star just for bass 
class this is the class of sound no speaker of this range is available in the world thanks jbl for quality of product ever seen
amazing product works for long time on one charge sound quality is fantastic bluetooth connection strong as doesn even stutter upto m cons colour coating wears of on the corners only one device can get connected 
bought fro in oct have been using regularly very loud and clear sound with adequate bass and treble havent found any speaker better than this one in this price range its better than my sony bravia tv speakers bluetooth is easy to connect and auto switches off after idle time gap build quality is solid vfm and must buy product for music lovers
good product good sound considering the process range only drawback is that bluetooth is sometimes disconnected and takes few efforts to reconnect the same 
this product has an amazing sound quality which enhances the built in bass making it really loud for small piece of speaker like this one the material quality too is very good however there room for improvement with the battery life of the product which could be far better than this 
the jbl branding attracted me got it for inr it worth every penny pros the material quality is really gud and feels very classic rubberised grip and cubaoidal shape give it materialistic looks button response is gud the nrf bluetooth pairs really fast cons speaker is not very loud
sound is quite good loud with nice bass and all battery life also favorable for long time at medium sound shockproof and non dust product ve been using this since month now but found no noticeable problems 
perfect finishing amazing product have been using it for almost years now and this is the second time ordered for friend the sound quality is nice and it can be really loud if needed also it charges fast and has very good battery life highly recommend jbl rocks 
excellent sound portable it is small but can produce high sound sound quality is also good in this price range it is one of the best bluetooth speaker there is one slight problem e the battery life is little less than expected 
sundar sasta tikau battery life good too sound is awesome like all bluetooth speaker it lacks heavy bass but covers that with it loud volume
amazing quality not at all disappointing bought it in the prime day deal smaller than expected but no compromise on sound quality 
i am very fond of jbl sound systems and this is another one which is very awesome size is small can easily be put in your pocket lol and the sound in comparison to the size is top class price is little bit high but if you want to experience the sound you should go for it 
i really liked how jbl succeeded to pack such great set of driver in this small form factor with an adequate battery pack that gets the job more than just done the only downsode felt that when the bass is high the mids and trebel gets little suppresed making you feel that volume has been turned down still great peice of audio with quality plastic and metal grill for protection 
from the house of jbl the speaker is quite nice in the looks and sounds is great it has good battery life and fits in your palm you can take it anywhere you like 
sound average sound quality is not much batter than expectations look awesome bluetooth connectivity nice easy to use easy to carry battery backup nice
just one word awsome product sound quality good battery backup is also good just loved it 
jbl go has exceeded my expectations the sound clarity is superb the built is small enough to fit in pocket and the battery life is amazing been using it for month and it has been one of my best purchase in amazon 
superb speaker good sound quality maximum volume will shatter the sound battery life is great single charge will go for full day hrs plus is volume is not that high its difficult to change volume by pressing speaker as single press change track and long press will change volume 
writing this review after years of satisfied usage im just amazed at how long it has served pleasantly surprised 
top quality product by jbl for the money spend don go for cheap speakers go for branded ones as they are of good quality and has great service the sound is perfect and has some bass in it good for small rooms and outdoor and can even be used in cars 
got this for my mom coz she is teacher she needs this for her class so everyone can listen what is going on the laptop this is my second buy from jbl
quite sound for small body clean and clear sound almost up to full volume which is easily enough to fill up big room this thing found it perfect spot beside my bed for late night melodies just to get my sleep right this sits just at hand distance so that can just switch it off and slide in to my sleep very convenient loud enough reasonable bass for its size very much recommended for casual music listening not for people who expect music system kind of sound quality 
nice sound quality in this range of speaker i satisfied with the sound quality gives best sound at loud volume as well compact size can carry anywhere good connectivity with bluetooth must buy product value for money 
not very very loud but adequate sound quality is good looks super cute charge stays on for good time very portable and easy to operate connects to almost all the devices light indicates charge normal micro usb charger easy to find therefore you ll never run out of charge 
amazing product very good sound quality the sound stays clear in loud volume and high pitch too very portable light weight easy to carry around very good battery life of around hours wished if it would have lasted more but nothing satisfies the battery life these days the more you get the more you want 
the speaker is very handy and the rubberized finish is really good the sound unexpectedly is quite loud and clear bass is ok can complain at this price range felt slight distortion when on full volume but nothing much noticeable to volume is most of the time enough for an average size room easily gets paired with my ipad laptop and phones no issues there 
liked the product but not satisfied with the packaging had received used product for the first time so replaced it later when received the replaced one it had damaged package wondering if it will affect the performance so far nothing had happened speakers are quite durable is guess speakers are good very handy you can take them anywhere and do not require any carry bag they fit easily in your pocket sound is awesome quite loud for this price range best option for small and portable speaker

at this price point this is one of the most affordable portable speakers that you can buy wish they had given hook clip along with the product to clip it on to bags there isn a lot of bass so if you want meaty base sound you should try one of jbls larger models 
you can imagine how small this speaker is sound quality is fatafati most important part is it bass osadharon or in one word don listen to unknown youtubers they are just reviewing for money it built quality is awesome and it has rubber body you should try this
jbl go got it in lightning deal for rs it very loud and has decent bass very ideal if you watch movies on laptops or if you like to play songs from your mobile just go for it note one need to keep the volume at about to in the laptop or mobile or other device so that the jbl does not produce distorted sound cheers

seriously am very curious while buying this product but really this is awesome product if you want speaker with awesome sound battery and material then you must go for it it will always above as your expectation it also has microphone you can take call through speaker 
i am giving review after using nearly months it superb boss and sound system and while calling also it is clears the noise just go for jbl if they provide some hanging thread for iteam it could be better while in jouney 
for the price paid this provides adequate listening experience with very decent sound quality that is well balanced and clear the highs and mids are articulated well the bass is also present and noticeable but do not expect rumbling deeps and thumps this is not the speaker for that its perfect speaker for casual music and for browsing youtube videos and tedx lectures this is definitely not my pick for serious music sessions or for group listening this is strictly for personal use only for better music quality combined with portability ll pick hk onyx series 
jbl again full fill my expectation amazing product for this price range it gives mind blowing output for normal room good clarity and nice bass easy to handle and can put anywhere we go

jbl go just amazed me knew it would be good but so good at you would be surely satisfied with its sound quality and loudness sound is crystal clear with awesome bass and tremble battery back up found to be the best among others phillips zoook etc if you are looking for small speaker less than its certainly the best 
absolutely good product working from the day received it can use that as speaker phone as well not sure how to use the hands free on that liked the range of volume is shows from minimum to maximum
i read lot of reviews for the boat and this one it can be very confusing went for the jbl anyways because of the brand and it works like charm using it for my rides the sound clarity and volume are amazing on this loudness is much more than what you would expect bang for buck on this one 
ossum product sound quality and battery life is too good aur bhaai bahut achha hai chhote packet me bada dhamaka hai got it on sale of 
i should say that delivery was quick fast appreciate it loved the product sound quality is good bluetooth connevtivity is nice like the size of it easy to carry any where 
great speaker connects easily battery life is more than hours and sound quality is very good happy with the purchase 
just go for it m not gonna write long review just know that it is very loud considering it is very compact and it fits in your palm bass is good 
good for small room bass was expected better but sound clarity is superb very light weight will come into your pocket easily 
well this is no brainer the sound quality is good with clear high and low notes loud enough to fill the room even when the ac is on and very easy connectivity it gives great battery life hours and is very sturdy it fell down couple of times but as the outer coat is premium plastic rubber feel there is absolutely no damage it very versatile and user friendly thumbs up
got it for awesome product pros very handy and light weight sound quality is good less charging time can attend calls cons battery life is not as expected while answering call mic is not that sensitive overall itz an ultra portable awesome product 
perfect very cute compact beautifully designed only size looks smaller expected it to be big but small is cute
sound is really very good and loud just amazed that such small speakers can make such loud sounds bass is also good as expected of w speakers not so much but yeah comfortable worth the money bought if for best ever in this price range edit after months of usage it stopped working for some reason it wasn being turned thought battery issue but it didn turned on after charging for day then talked on harman jbl customer number and was amazed by the service they replaced my product at first they told me to visit service centre but as live far away in greater noida the service centre was in gurugram they said to courier the product on the service centre with reference id over it but then they called and also arranged pickup for me product was taken and within days recieved complete new jbl go they replaced my product completely m just amazed by the service of harman just buy it this product is too good
excellent speakers for its size and the money inbuilt mic makes it awesome you can attend phone calls while playing music best value for money don expect great bass quality of sound it good 
what an excellent product palm sized has matte finish and looks very sleek performs excellent the speakers can go very loud for such small little thing however there is distortion of bass at really high volumes but that okay the only problem had was when the device was connected to my phone through bluetooth it would sometimes switch off by itself which did not happen with an aux cord would recommend 
it awesome sound quality is more than good material quality is also good voice clarity is also fine you will definitely love this tiny speaker plz go ahead jbl rocks
good product in the price range but feel like sound and other qualities are somewhat ok considering boat or even philips retains charge for almost hours so for budget range it is good 
it is good product and worth to buy it sound clarity is supreb iam using this product from past three months and never faced any issue with it it is looks like small but making huge noise with good sound quality and battery back up also excellent 
i bought it for my daughter and mom as they listen to songs on their phone it is good for that purpose sound quality is ok ok not very good but not bad either good for room sound on maximum volume is not good although would have wanted better one but for the budget buyers think it should be ok do not have experience of other products in the same price range so cant really compare 
more than one year since bought the product and still working sound quality good use daily for one and half hour and can use for days before charging again so battery life is also good overall worth the money 
more than the expectation awesome sound reasonable battery life classic looks no regrets strongly recommended
decently loud hours battery backup durable using since year and it is as new very good built qualith
simply the best and total value for money just go for it blindly what an amazing product with super sound quality m just so much in love with it just make sure you sufficiently charge it if you re planning to use it outdoor 
excellent product from jbl really loved it it sound it compactness it a portable speaker made for music lovers it connectivity also very easy and fast it durable and will definitely recommend you to buy the best part is it has aux in put and mic which allows you to speak through the mic when attend phone call and it has really clear sound without any noise but one thing have noticed that it has very poor performance when comes to its battery it lasts hardly hrs when play nonstop music with loud volume but apart from that its fabulous product go for it 
i ordered this product thinking whether it would be good or not but trust me its amazing it is powwrful speaker for daily use unless you dont get duplicate product gets charged in about hours and plays for around to hours atleast very impressive from jbl and at good price 
i am extremely happy with this product could not believe that this small device can be so great to produce clear and great sound it is perfect for small parties it is very easy to connect and very handy even it can go in pocket would like to highly recommend this amazon was great in delivering this product on time and am very happy with their service regards prachi
everything is perfect as expected but only disappointment is that the bettery life is not as told it was informed that the life of battery is for hours with single full charge but it not lasting for hours its not even lasting for good hours it would be be if you can looj into this part other than that everything is kool 
for long time was looking for bluetooth speaker and this one was just the one was looking for its sound quality be it the material quality it feels so premium at the price it just stands out for the kind of good product it is just that it would had been more good if jbl starts providing charging adapter also with the product and with the usb cable
if anyone knows how to do good sound it jbl and they do not dissappoint with product in this size and price m writing this review after using this for almost year and boy is this amazing many mini portable speakers lack in delivering good sound that crisp and falter on the bass too but this baby is everything it loud as well if that what you re looking for really can fill up the space in party 
i just received the speaker today loved the speaker because of it compact size and it rate after long wait finally bought this and it is smaller than expected sound quality is not very good but it good and clear after all it jbl great work by amazon received it the next day of placing my order overall it a good deal just one thing that in warranty card it is mentioned about the guarantee is for the item sold within australia idk what that means 
wow love it lovely sound specially colour what quality product m soooooo happy must buy rate is also less 
first let talk about it build quality got the product in very good condition and the built quality is best in the price range the sound quality was awesome and think the speaker is the best speaker in this price range if you found this review helpful then please click on that helpful button 
awesome sound output enough for room smaller than size of your palm easy to carry anywhere dont expect much bass but the treble and sound clarity is spot on if you are looking for speaker below rs this is the beast for you
i am using this product for months now am writting some pros about this the sound quality is pretty good the battery life is also awasome the bass is pretty average bluetooth connectivity is very strong now am writting some cons about this product the charging time approximately hours the charging light indicator does not work properly although this is the best value for money product 
bought it as gift for friend and she loves it it been month since the purchase and it works fine so far obviously don expect it to be very loud as the loudness range is less than jbl flip but found it perfect for at hostel single person usage the colours are cute and it comes with cable to charge but there wasn any stamped warranty card nevertheless m sure amazon handles that it very much portable and easy to carry 
absolutely loved the product had jbl speaker already and was happy with it the compact size and light weight make it extremely portable 
it portability is its biggest plus point small convenient and good quality sound all in one really like it 
wanted to have decent bluetooth speaker did lot of research and finally selected this excellent sound quality and personalised sound good for sitting together and watching tv or listening music no need for second thought go ahead 
it is loud for its size and the overall sound quality is unmatched in its segment love how it is compact but still gives great sound quality pairing is easy and battery life is good gave me more than five hours when played at moderate volume 
best in bluetooth speaker segment worth every penny go for it don think best and melodious sound quality 
it actually an average product but taking the discounted price the mrp is really high in account it is good the sound quality is good loudness is also good for small room or if you want to hear the music from within mtr distance 
i was bit sceptical about buying jbl go saw lot of comparison reviews on youtube its only competitor is logitech x believe me the brand speaks for itself got it for bluetooth facility is awesome output is w read that the bass is not up to the mark but given the size of the speaker its cool treble is loud enough to fill the room
a must buy product excellent speakers excellent sound quality great built quality and great value for money speakers in jbl and also portable and easy to carry in just your pocket sound in is very pure and good range loud sounds 
pros sound quality is very good comparing to other cheap products battery backup is fine almost hours to hours size is small charging time is less than minutes cons sound is not very loud but loud enough for room base sound breaks if used in full volume in iphone bought it at rs which is higher go for it if you get it at price of rs you won regret 
best portable speaker easy to pair easy to operate and simple sound clarity is good don expect it to sound like boom box with room full of people it is lovely product for home use and use it daily totally recommend it 
this product is absolutely amazing crystal clear sound bluetooth connectivity is fast portable worth purchasing for those who want to listen quality audio m writing this review one year after purchased and still sound quality is as same as new 
got this on an offer price the shipment was fast packing was good after months of usage can say that it working great the sound seemed too good in the beginning even though it doesn feel that great after months of use thats only because you get used to the sound so it doesn sound new anymore it still is pretty durable speaker you can for it 
its almost year when have purchased this jbl speaker cant explain how superb quality and trust have on this speaker its battery life is also ok ok but the sound it has is almost outstanding the baas is superb jbl the name is enough
it really nice and worth for the price had ordered it before months and using it since last months without any issues battery is also very good and lasts very long great value for money 
a no nonsense speaker smartly built extremely compact with decent sound bass is good and at this price range one of the best speakers to go for jbl is strong brand to consider 
sound quality as well as bass is awesome in this proce range as well as in this shape and size overall product quality is nice and bhild quality is awesome it is value foe money product 
undoubtedly amazing product the sound quality matches that of the bose build quality is very good the quoting is soft rubber feels good to hold in hand size inch inch inch for its size the sound quality and quantity is astonishing sounds as loud as half volume of speaker car stereo very crisp and clear sound very good battery life lasts more than hours m very satisfied with the purchase 
i ordered one for my office when had need to use something to get better output during team meetings it had decent microphone input and speaker output so it did my job out of the blue tried testing it for music and non conversational use it was amazing and next day itself ordered one for myself too enjoy taking it along with me while go for cycling and even clip it on my motorcycle to enjoy some music during rides material is quite sturdy so dont worry much about breakage protect from water though 
overall good product but just that it could have been easier to use when you press the bluetooth button there should be light on indicating that the bluetooth is now on or in use similarly with the volume buttons we have to make do with the guess work 
its great speaker which really liked it its sound quality is fine but having moderate bass and also its sound is less as compairing to other speakers its battery life is mentioned upto for hrs but it ended in hrs overall fine speaker but their are more speakers at this price range 
good at this price range negative points loudness is less than my expectation bass is less battery backup is to hours guess positive points portable and built quality is good overall sound quality is good sound do not go outside from one room so no body will complain reliable product guess 
in my opinion it is the best product for the price are you looking to buy good bluetooth speaker suggest you to buy this product am sure it will impress you really liked this product if this comparing to the boat bluetooth speaker it has more sound quality and battery than it it only need hour to charge it its music playing time upto hours it is light weight comparing to other products it weight is g you can use this product when you go to picnic its size is small but it gives you big sound it has very good sound quality it has one year warranty don buy cheap price bluetooth speaker buy this type of good bluetooth speaker 
i like the portability sound quality and noise control great bass as musician this product would help me lot the quality is too good 
very good speaker as guaranteed by jbl material quality sound quality and battery life is awesome it looks cute in red colour battery life is very good as compared to my philips speaker it runs more than to hrs everything is as promised by jbl thank you amazon for good offer and delivery
better than expectations sound is pretty loud was going to buy bose mini version but this one saved lot of money and perfect for small house party with few friends 
best in million my friend has mi speaker which he got in rs told him want to buy new speaker my mind was all set for jbl go but then he told me to use mi speaker but bought this one and compare the build quality and sound output was gone mad when heard it voice it the perfect the build quality is like rubber is covering the whole thing whenever you fall it it wouldn break because of rubber attached to it it has in built mic which loved the most too it has noice cancelation and what you need now 
be it sound clarity or battery life was thoroughly impressed with the this jbl go speaker first off got the speaker from deal found on grabon always wanted wireless speaker and the deal looked too precious to pass off got it for rs now coming to the products the battery life is amazing sometimes charge after days even after using it for hours at stretch it can last up to hours on single charge with continuous usage the colour is beautiful doesn hurt the eye the price is amazing for what it offers you can turn it up with an aux cable if it doesn connect via bluetooth which will never happen you can use it on your pc since pcs don come with bluetooth the deep basses are amazing for portable speaker has in built call function 
jbl go is really value for money product the sound quality is amazing and can carry it with me anywhere go bought ofr rs from amazon and have been using it everyday fro the past one year 
i have paired the jbl go speaker via bt with my amazon echo dot firstly the pairing is quite stable and does not disconnect too often more importantly the sound that this speaker reproduces is absolutely amazing it is much louder and clearer than the audio from my tv it is real pleasure to listen to music on this device at volume nobody would believe that the incredibly loud and crisp sound can emanate from such tiny speaker real must buy highly recommended 
it is one of the best the only problem is that it does not support usb the bass is little bit low so you are bass lover try something else it is really good for small rooms 
got this little dynamite today red colour and it has exceeded beyond my expectations didnt expect such great sound from this little monster have got to give this credit after all its jbl sound clarity is awesome bass depends on where place it though very minimal its size is really small under this price jbl has created masterpiece got it for rs extra given to delivery guy dont compare with other portable speakers in this range its the best so all audiophiles out there get this without giving any extra thoughts its simply best you wont regret it 
me and many friends and relatives have bought the same product and absolutley love the speaker affordable and powerful enough for our in house parties for the first time for me only one out of the last one ordered seems to have defect and am returning that one guess ll see the promptness of amazon in in that too everyone was very surprised at how quick and easy the ordering and delivery is for such state of the art device kudos amazon in and jbl
nice sound build quality was much good very less bass but sound quality was very good if want speakers for single room then it is best otherwise there is no more such expectation with this speaker
this really good one piece to collect color is good sound is good led indication of charge completion using is very easy whenever we charge it red led glows after completion of charge it goes off like it for its build quality sound quality and all that small manual is inside the product box good one 
bought it for my mom so cute surprisingly loud for its size easy to use good connectivity 
me and my family likes the product so much worth purchasing for its sound quality is actually good and it is easy to handle it is charged very fastly go for it
great bluetooth speaker for the price amazing sound quality and great battery life with great range of connectivity and the build quality is rugged it can withstand multiple accidental drops but for the price the better choice is this amzn to gmca
ordered it twice for gift awesome sound of jbl portable easy bluetooth connection colour is nice looks cute music sound both awesome
great device have been using it from feew months and the experience has been great great treble good bass loud clear portable
i got this for my dad and he just loves it it become my dad companion this was his first experience with bluetooth he so happy that he can carry the speaker anywhere in the house and even though if he forgets it in the kitchen he can still hear it crystal clear in the verandah thanks jbl 
excellent performance tiny speaker but with good sound quality very convenient you carry in your pocket crystal clear sound with good bass thanks amazon 
posting this review after years of purchase for this wonderful and acoustical speaker worked seamlessly and effortlessly fine for years without any problem after years of its usage can summarize now that it battery age is years as now it discharges own it own like may be after mins or after hr 
perfect item for good quality speaker for room of approx sqft bought it for on deal on amazon value for money
sound quality very good very loud good for indoor and for small outdoor purposes too rectangle shape easy to handle and stable colors very bright 
excellent bang for your buck small in size quite loud for my taste the sound is too bassy would have loved it to be set with little more treble than it is excellent build quality and more than adequate battety life for my use hours per evening no regrets about the purchase best thing is can take it around the house and listen to music anywhere bedroom kitchen study or on the rooftop highly recommended 
i was bit disappointed at the first sight of the product as it looked too small than imagined but my disappointment was over as soon as heard it its sound is much bigger than its size its overall good handy speaker 
just wish it had bass otherwise the sound is loud enough no sound distortion even at high volume good bluetooth capability the material is high quality with top notch finish by jbl looks damn good also easy to carry fits in your palm its that small 
good for the price compact and good sound and reasonable bass 
the sound is awesome sometimes it got connection issues also gets automatically turned off buy recommended good for all occasions 
superb quality speaker ordered red colour looks nice handy sound quality is good awesome bass overall it a decent product 
it is worth but product everything sounds great bass is incredible only issue was sound is either too high or too low it was tough to find the perfect volume 
sound quality is good its not until you compare with other higher models that you feel that they have better sound quality but this is very good cheap alternative using for almost years now and no complaints have taken it on several trips
how cute can speaker be just love it wanted to buy this since long time my frds even use it for house parties amazing color amazing quality super cute for such cheap price would prefer portability over anytn it fits my back jeans pockets easy to carry love it
tiny yet powerful asecetic look good battery life quick connectivity user friendly sound quality is very good
the speakers are loud and clear despite of its small size the quality of the sound is so good and clear that for small to medium rooms will feel like r sitting inside the recording studio 
very good sound loud and clear paired easily with my mobile we can watch movies on mobile with this speaker and mobile stand 
ok to hear facebook and whatsapp videos can use for youtube also but not upto the level to speak phone calls mic is not so clear to hear our voice by the opposite caller other than that quality of material and battery are so good 
the battery is little less which is understandable but it fulfills it purpose well portable good sound and seamless connectivity with all my devices love the product 
reviewing this after daily usage for months and oh boy does this deliver on all my music needs excellent crisp sound over bluetooth and perfect bass and audio quality great bluetooth speakers for the price you won be dissapointed 
excellent speaker great sound quality play music through jbl music app in playstore its an amazing experience 
iam using this product about month and my experience is this is one of the best product have purchased from amazon battery life and sound quality is soo good and especially the design is awesome and build quality is excellent really love this product 
i have been using this speaker it is so good with such price and also the sound quality is so much better being so tiny it still has that bass and for watching movies it gives a clearer sound and is too handy overall am super happy with jbl launching this as anyone can afford it 
got it in though there were other options available in lesser price but decided to go with the brand jbl and must say m happy with the product body touch and feel is very nice it has rubber finish all around bluetooth connectivity range is good enough for home sound quality could have been better but cannot expect more at this range 
jbl keeps up with the brand equity don expect it to make your house party lively enough sound quality to enjoy in car or just while chilling out with friends in peaceful environment comes within the grasp of your hand so portability gets stars 
sound good quality output high sound fidelity clear mid range and bass battery almost hr of run time misc quite portable charges qucikly sturdy
love it beyond the expectations 
awesome for the quoted price excellent sound quality though for home or smaller places not loud enough for busy outdoors may be good for quieter outdoors though perfect and compact to carry on travel overall totally worth 
i gift this speaker to my friend on this birthday this is the best speaker in this range even the battery backup is also great
sturdy and beautiful sound quality is great not tested the battery life but it does not die quickly 
very much satisfied with the jbl speaker both material and sound wise got it in time aswell so far so good no complain thanks to amazon for the affordable price rs not forgetting my mom too compliment about it 
jbl product is awesome it has amazing sound battery backup is nice as well it can give you to hours non stop music play just one problem faced sometimes switch on off button does not work well it gets time to on and off that is only problem if you are looking wireless speaker then guys go for it 
this is my second jbl go speaker the first one had purchased around months back cricket blue colour jbl are known for their sound devices and they dont disappoint with this small but awesome product not too expensive just about right size to carry in your pockets or can be used in car as handsfree unit sound is too good which first timer will not expect looking at the size of the unit this unit personifies big things come in small packages 
i have never felt this feel before from protable speaker fantastic with this speaker the best moment d noticed is when listen to black sabbath war pigs love the song and black sabbath love the speaker ve listen to sony boat and others love this one 
my mom and sis are the prime users of this and looking at them fighting over it proves that this is good product bought one from proteomics but it turned out to be sub par
a must buy type things it is don believe the size its truly just same as the size of your palm but sure that its sound will blow your mind loved it superb quality 
i usually do not trust online stuffs but let me tell you that this is one amazing speaker the range of bluetooth connectivity is so large that my device was in the other corner of house and the music was pretty clear good investment of money in this product 
the jbl bluetooth speaker is of very good quality it delivers loud clear audio and lasts for hours it has also good bass first got defective piece which was not charging thanks to amazon that they accepted the replacement and now am able to enjoy the music 
yeah like the sound quality of the speaker it portable easy to carry outside but it little small it has shiny look have black colour would recommend those people who looking to buy bluetooth speaker under and it has nice connectivity too m satisfied with this product
got the product on time package was very poorly done still feel it was used product sold to me nevertheless when started listening to music it made me forget everything 
amazing product great sound quality for such pint size at this price it a steal highly recommended 
this product is small in size and big on quality never expected it to be so good bought one for my father as he needed small speaker for listening old songs without disturbing anyone else and was sceptical but the sound and the built is very fine it worth spending bucks and won disappoint you got one again for myself and it as good as the first one 
got my order today july the product sound is amazing with xtreme bass just loved it m using rooted phone with dolby atmos and viperandroid audio modules installed it gives great output with this speaker thank you amazon for quick delivery and jbl for this amazing product 
the product was absolutely amazing the sound quality it offers is simply awesome at first thought that with such small body factor it would not be able to provide good and loud sound quality but when listened to it became completely wrong would simply suggest this product to all those who are looking into it thank you 
one of the best bluetooth speaker ever bought this portable speaker is compact very easy to carry easy to connect with the bluetooth connectivity and the sound quality is very good and this pop of mustard yellow colour looks awesome 
i love love these this is my second quantity of this product first one got misplaced while we were shifting our home so bought exactly same thing again it is so convenient to carry this one and fits easily into my kitchen bathroom and super for camping too the bass is excellent and sound quality is superb you won be disappointed with this love love these jbl babies 
jbl this name is everything for me bcoz m music lover purchase it for my baby girl of month who also like music everything in this speaker is perfect size is suitable for pocket sound quality is awesome both in treble and bass few of customer reviewed that sound is not clear above its wrong m certified buyer so suggest to buy it without any doubt
it small but there is saying chota bomb bada dhamaka liked the sound output it very good bass is also good it easy to carry anywhere no problem with the battery too love you jbl delivery was in days loving it 
am writing this after months and months of usage hesitated to buy jbl go instead of jbl go after buying it no hesitation it satisfied the expectations sound quality and bluetooth connectivity is good and holds prety much sufficient battery run time 
great product nice sound quality and nice build the colour of the product is nice as well on the time delivery by amazon as expected 
it sounds very good very portable and ruget the buttons are little difficult to use but overall an excellent product the sound can light up even big hall
i got it for but you can buy it for in sale days or even less it is worth of every penny battery backup is good like weight portable strong built 
the very good thing is it carry easily sound quality is good bass is medium battery is good use year but it work nearby same time but if connect the two devise one by one some time is face time you could type bluetooth symbol quit time the it easily connect other devise overall under this prize it is too good with brand 
awesome sound quality am impressed by this xx inch box very easy to connect strongly recommend am writing the review on day one used the product so cannot comment on the battery life 
awesome product champion of its class genuine product recieved durable high audio quality good for max so feet room good experience 
absolutely fabulous product by jbl its handy easy to carry around and comes with surprisingly high volume with crisp bass sound clarity is very good highly recommend for travellers and quality music listeners jbl never disappoints 
good quality speakers no problems with the bass if you re more into rock and metal good volume for its size looks beautiful too fits in your palm definitely the best speaker in its price range takes only about mins for full charge which lasts very good time perfect travel partner has the added merit of an inbuilt mic highly recommended 
absolutely amazing product at this price range must buy for sure the sound quality is really amazing and the bluetooth connectivity is top notch 
it a small with best sound in watt speaker range build material is good looks very good bass is good battery life is good sufficient for medium rooms its actually very loud
i have purchased it month before till now it working fine you must go for it nice product nice sound quality and device is portable mic is also good 
as expected very good product by jbl pairing with devices was quick and easy for the price it gets the job done the sound has appreciable bass and is quite loud highly recommended 
it the best blue tooth speaker in every aspect great sound for this price fair enough range portable good battery backup best of all lifespan it been more than one year since bought it still working good as new
worth the price very good sound quality and easy connectivity to bluetooth it is sleek modern and classy can be taken anywhere and easily portable 
so being of great confusion before buying this product think everyone who likes reading review before buying product would like to know about this speaker if they re comparing it to others first of all it has great value for money in comparison to the sound quality and pocket size speaker it has loud enough sound not party speaker though it would be loud enough for an average sized room recommend it to anyone who would like portable speaker with cheap price and good quality ordering another one for my brother as it is product that everyone deserves to have 
it is an excellent product at this price range was bit confused between the two speaker that is boat stone and jbl go that which speaker should buy but selected this speaker because love to listen vocals and music more than the high bass music it vocals are very loud and clear but you might get little bit disappointed if you are bass lover finally concluded that its build quality and sound quality is amazing but it is not water resistant that the weak point in this 
pros good sound clarity no distortion even at high volumes small and compact design very light weight really portable bluetooth connectivity is seamless and range is good loud enough for single room cons bass could have been bit better although this does justice to its cost buy it if you are getting it under 
i love this product amazing product sound quality is too good for the size of the speaker loud enough to fill your room no distortion or crackling of sound at full volume ideal for relaxing and chilling out in your room 
so if you are living alone in hostel or with buddies this product is just for you honestly don think that this ll give you the feeling of big home theaters like marshall bose or beats but if you in small room or quite normal house don think about it just buy it 
jbl go portable wireless bluetooth speaker is simply suberb very nice sound quality as well it size is too small you can carry it anywhere portable worth buying
used hardly for months but it fab comes in very good packaging and very easy to use and light to carry battery life as ve observed is good 
received the product today am in love with this product sound is very clear and good have to see after using for long time but have good experience with this speaker because my friend was using this speaker for long time it worth buying it for go for it 
this is the best speaker for the size its highs and mids are so clear and surprisingly the bass is so pure without any difficulties with the size it has and lastly worth the money coz purchased it for but can get on offers for like k or k so guys go for it coz its very much handy 
excellent one have been using it since last one year after purchase and still there is no single complaint purchased it in the offer for and think it real good value for money
very cute looking small box sound is very clear and loud can be listened on volume as per need low nodes instrumental music is also very clear very fast bluetooth connectivity overall this small speaker is value for money have bought for k 
super awesome semma sound worth for buying iam using basic mobile samsung music guru no bluetooth but aux cable is more useful iam connecting bluetooth to my pc and laptop overall give for jbl brand keep rocking hats off amazon keep growing 
got this speaker while it was in lighting deal its great buy super happy with its sound quality wonder how such little thing produces such loud sound 
not words to say about this in this price range when received it found it smaller than my expectations but when connected it just loved it this good product must say 
gifted this to my sister and she loves it it has better sound quality and bluetooth connectivity 
absolutely amazing product trust me just go for it have tried and tested almost everything in this range by going in store like croma ezone and nothing so far has beaten this guy except bose 
awesome speaker no product match this much of sound profile in the price range clear high end and decent base great for home and hostel but if you are looking for outdoor party sound go for bigger wattage speakers didn mean this one has low sound output but you can expect tiny speaker more than average volume 
good sound quality battery life about hours great for rooms road trips loving it but expected loud sounds which is woe overall its great got it for still think its overpriced being made in china it would be best if it priced at rs btw love your sound quality jbl thanks amazon for sending it to me 
it fits on the palm of your hand they are super loud at max volume but won be too loud in noisy or croudy place jbl is well known for it speakers with the balanced bass and volume would recommend everyone who wants decently loud speaker with the perfect bass in reasonable price to go ahead for this speaker 
sound is ok not much to talk about clear voice calling compact battery backup is good 
nice one it is giving the original sound as it is nice bass we get the sounds of big woofers speaker in this the sound is not so high but the clarity is high we can connect through bluetooth and aux 
bought it last month great sound quality very handy and nice product bought one more to gift hope it keeps up my faith by going good for years
very good speakers when properly connected the sound quality is pretty good and loudness is also enough sometimes bluetooth connectivity creates problem and speaker needs to kept at some distance from mobile for proper connection 
awesome speaker must buy it love each and everything of the product totally paisa vasool thanks amazon for the products guys doing fab job keep the products price low and entertain with awesome products khazana like this 
i bought this product as it comes from one of the best speaker manufacturer jbl really appreciate this product with best prise and material quality the usp of the product is its sound quality which is superb and crystal clear with bass effects worth to buy it bought two quantities red blue one for my soulmate and one for myself 
color pink beautiful the sound quality is superb including its volume and bass have other portable bluetooth speakers as well but not as good as jbl easy to connect and good battery life better than jbl go

absolutely amazing product good for listening songs conference calls video calls skype calls one product for many purposes must have product
as you know it is the brand jbl so will be best and worth the prize but but but when purchased it got wrong and not malfunction speaker which sound not working good olmost bass is gone i just replased it easily if it happens with you just replace it
nice product but usb charging jack length is very short bass is good sound is ok if have one usb port for pendrive then it would be best option for travel 
writing the review after two years of use and second order excellent product and good sound quality worth the money 
i did not expected it would be that good even thou think price is bit high in compare to other speakers but it worth it product is great its been month am using it

this is an excellent bluetooth speaker with punchy sound and crisp vocals filling up the room the small size is disguising for its loud sound output excellent for light music youtube and mobile games

i gifted it to my friend and she absolutely loved it of course the sound clarity and volume is great got it on offer worth the buy
no pendrive or sd card support so if dont have ur favourite music in your bluetooth device will have to use data or internet etc otherwise awesome
adorable speaker and super duper handy fits into anybag and can carry it any where sound quality is really good just wish the speaker was on sides rather than one
indeed an awesome piece of sound by jbl provides very clear sound and it colour is the best was in nice packing and swift delivery you should surely go for this one leaving the rest loved it thanks amazon

i really gotta appreciate the technology here if you re searching for small and compatible speaker in decent budget within rs this is the best buy m pretty impressed by jbl sound quality but this device let say has got bit less of bass but it worth the buy

amazon as always well packed timely delivered jbl go it maintain its name so well its more and months yet works fine no distortion at all it battery backup is also the finest seen so far no regrets trust me it the best product at its price and in specified space 
small cute and loud enough works well good sound and bass quality very compact and easy to carry yet quiet loud for small party or to listen to personally
in this price stack this is the best you are gonna get this little boy works quite impressive and delivers the overall satisfactory performance bass is up to the expectations portable and rigid 
at first glance it didn look worthy enough for the price but it is sound quality is superb amazes how small it can be yet perform extremely well battery life is also good overall if your looking for best bt speaker under d prefer to purchase this 
i purchased it during the aug sale very much happy with the quality of sound and material good and eye catching colour variants battery back up is good good range of bluetooth connectivity at last amazing sound clarity 
i have been using this for months now the battery charge lasts longer than is claimed amazing product at amazing price just go for jbl go 
sounds very good compared with other speakers and this blows them away in sound clarity and bass best quality at high volume this should have card slot this is the only disappoinment 
this is one of the finest devices for travel battery lasts long easy to charge and built quality is amazing prices are competitive as well gifted this to some of my colleagues and they we re thrilled update after using it on few trips really worth it and couldn have asked for more so easy to pair and the battery backup is wonderful good sound for such tiny speaker and more than enough for room or outdoor camping spots overall very happy
superbb one of the best in portable bluetooth speakers sound is superbb use it mostly for watching movies on mac or ipad never seems to run out of battery at all also seems to be charging very fast well worth the price 
light weight compact good sound quality great for listening songs in small to mid sized space
superb design handy light weight colourful compact jbl speaker sound quality is good clear enough for single room use poweramp and other music enhancement player in your android to further boost your sounds and to get crystal clear voice microphone works fine for calls loud enough deserves five star though bit pricy but jbl is brand and never disappoints you 
amazing stuff so happy to have this at home have stopped watching tv and listen to songs
jbl go is very nice heavy duty sound and clear sound jbl go best output sound nice bluetooth and quick connectivity 
best product ever used using for yrs straight hrs daily no issue is sound till date only the battery backup lows down after year and half but not much after yrs it also starts picking yup rust overall best speaker to buy it won disappoint you ever
i ve got this in flash sale for inr and it more than worth it audio is crisp and deep base output with small form factor 
just go for it the sound quality the built quality and the materials used to build it ensures safe handling as it can be dropped sometimes accidentally but because of the galavanised rubber used its in top shape even after rough handling and the sound is superb go for it 
the sound quality is amazing it could be playing in one room and you can perfectly hear it from some other room the only significant problem is that the bluetooth range is short if the source device is in some other room the speakers might not catch signals well rest all great and it charges pretty fast
it a surprise out of the box definitely nothing so compact can match this little box in terms of clarity and loudness have seen people talking about bias my personal opinion why to expect bais with this little thing it has acceptable bais anyways pros exceptional performance on music where multiple instruments are playing nothing mixes up battery hrs vocals 
bluetooth connectivity and battery life are awesome sound quality is good have been using it for one year for playing songs and listening online lessons it very good portable speaker but it is very small sound is awesome blindly go 
best bluetooth speakers high output it can beat ma sony hifi speakers in quality vocals are great to hear also provides loud sound from this little thing worth buyng
clear sound think everything is good just base is normal
awesom bluetooth speaker sound quality is pretty good was lucky enough to get it for just ie the best deal you can ever get for jbl go this is the second time am buying this pros build quality hassle free connection great connectivity sound quality portability cons battery is just hours wish this number was higher though you can always carry portable charger if you can get jbl go for or less then simply go for it if water proof feature is what you are after then you can go for jbl go next is jbl flip on my list 
very happy jbl can go wrong with it 
amazing product works for long time on one charge sound quality is fantastic bluetooth connection strong as doesn even stutter upto m cons colour coating wears of on the corners only one device can get connected 
good quality sound for it size 
great for travelling fits in ur pocket battery backup is good sound quality is good bass is okk overall good purchase cheers amazon 
okay so just received my speaker and its very loud and clear and the best available in the market for this price only thing didn like about this speaker is that think have received an used product but it working properly would have given it full stars but am not happy bcoz have received an used product

i am writing this review after month of regular usage of jbl go as per the name it has very good base the sound quality is great it is enough for small living room for bday party for to members the battery is amazing can use it for hours with minimum volume and in high volume it hours cost wise it is bit pricey but can get long life 
the speakers were fabulous better than expectations they re tiny can fit in the palm of your hand and lightweight so its easy to take them anywhere and use them with any device having bluetooth compatibility the sound quality is wonderful although there is no bass boost or subwoofer all in all great package at 
superb sound quality minimizes little when in high volume but it is sufficient for my purpose of small room and price is in budget super sound quality battery backup color compact features in love 
very useful but little bit noisy allover ok for my purpose 
good sound quality as the brand says it all about it handy with good finishing only the cone is battery back up is not up to the mark it last around hours rather not hours which is guranteed by the company 
good product
nice sound quality but don expect loud sound it is ok for small room only

best in million my friend has mi speaker which he got in rs told him want to buy new speaker my mind was all set for jbl go but then he told me to use mi speaker but bought this one and compare the build quality and sound output was gone mad when heard it voice it the perfect the build quality is like rubber is covering the whole thing whenever you fall it it wouldn break because of rubber attached to it it has in built mic which loved the most too it has noice cancelation and what you need now

i like the crystal clear voice of that speaker if the sound volume is little bit higher then it will must be good super product that must be top in market the material quantity is very good but you have to improve sound quality because it is not so higher sound but the battery life is so good and really impressed about this product thank you jbl 
this product is excellent by size it isnt that big just maybe around the size of your palm but the sound is so much more than you would expect out of it it truly quality product

this portable speaker is just too good speaker is very handy and light in weight nice attractive color blue and very gripping surface the quality of sound very very clear feel happy for choosing this product it charges is very less time and lasts for quite long although dont have record of full time to charge and time for full discharge but the ratio is what matters and it is quite good 
very happy with it its quite while now small but good for light music 
amazing product although if you plan to take it for road trips etc make sure carry ur charger too at full volume it doesn long last
excellent product at low price 
very very good product
i like sound quality it awesome product material but battery can be more best 
i was looking for portable speaker with no great expectations bought the jbl go because well its jbl and price was also ok during lightning deal got the pink colour and it is super cute the speaker feels sturdy with premium built sound is quite good considering its tiny size bass is great it works better with bluetooth as its sound really gets affected when connected with aux cable don know if that the general problem with this product or just the unit received otherwise m very satisfied and using it all the time 
the build quality is one of the best you wouldn find anything better built in this price range or higher for speaker of the same class the sound quality is super crisp vocals treble are excellent lacks little bass just little but overall quality is what you can expect from jbl battery life is good for regular use hrs day you ll have to recharge it once in days charges fast so that a plus point 
did not expected it to be that much good it looks small but gives awesome sound sound quality is really good so happy
as per its size sound is really good battery could be little bit better but its ok bluetooth connectivity is real fast satisfied with the product 
absolutely amazing product trust me just go for it have tried and tested almost everything in this range by going in store like croma ezone and nothing so far has beaten this guy except bose 
nice product yes there is battery issue in this as it does not have long lasting battery life otherwise nice product 
it been hours of usage i loving the product one of the best sounds have felt gr clarity no distortion very high range and of all verrrryyyyy loud audio m just in love with this was confused between jbl mi bt now my desision to buy this is looking pretty good
i really liked how jbl succeeded to pack such great set of driver in this small form factor with an adequate battery pack that gets the job more than just done the only downsode felt that when the bass is high the mids and trebel gets little suppresed making you feel that volume has been turned down still great peice of audio with quality plastic and metal grill for protection 
this is the best product purchased on amazon got this speakers at built quality and clarity of sound is superb in this price size of the speaker is very small but it is loud enough overall good product 
its awesome to have this product with you it will give you company in any mood you are in my suggestion grab it and take the flavour of this musical instrument star 
this speaker is small compact but packs punch with its clear loud sound the material is pleasant to handle and doesn get dirty easily the battery is as advertised the in built mic is of good quality because the person on the other side can clearly hear me even when there are numerous other background noise recommended buy and love it 
it is good product and worth to buy it sound clarity is supreb iam using this product from past three months and never faced any issue with it it is looks like small but making huge noise with good sound quality and battery back up also excellent 
very good product sound quality is excellent dependable 
worth it
excellent speakers considering the size very satisfying product from jbl
everyone should have given this five stars maybe some got faulty speaker or something or maybe some people don know anything about speakers and set their expectations too high this is watt speaker it is full watt more powerful than the standard portable bluetooth speakers and it definitely is full watt more powerful than my other high quality watt speakers the sound is also fuller because it is stereo standard travel speakers are usually mono it is also loud so bottom like is that for little travel buddy this speaker kicks ass have never been so much happier with speaker before truly just get it if you get faulty one return it and get the same thing again and do it again if you have to because you simply must have this speaker if you want little travel speaker with big heart ve been using it daily for over year now and full charge still lasts for hours of course it depends on the volume how you treat the battery etc but very happy oh and this speaker has microphone too so you can do full phone calls video calls etc which is nice other travel speakers do not have microphone so you can do speaker calls and the other person voice will come through the speaker but they will only hear you if you are close to your phone anyway this can be useful anyway thanks for reading and please click helpful below thanks 
suprisingly amazed by the sound and bass this small box can bring out extremely happy with the buy and it is very easy to use and connect if you are looking small and handy speaker to be carried along with you always recommend you to throw your money on this

i am always very choosy wid headphones speaker this one bought widout listening the output and trust me guys it actually is fantastic the bass and treble are perfectly matched for ppl wid great taste in music sound quality this lil box is just wat need for get set go trip
nice product in terms of usability portability 
sound quality is awesome and bluetooth connectivity is very fast and protability is also good but sound is awesome
excellent bang for your buck small in size quite loud for my taste the sound is too bassy would have loved it to be set with little more treble than it is excellent build quality and more than adequate battety life for my use hours per evening no regrets about the purchase best thing is can take it around the house and listen to music anywhere bedroom kitchen study or on the rooftop highly recommended 
this is the best found for the budget had sound quality is amazing for such low cost speaker battery life is good easy pairing and usage all in all recommend this speaker if you are looking for one

great product m using this for making my group meeting with the clients so either if receive the phone from client or else we have skype call or zoom call can have this on so that my team can also listen and communicate directly with the client superb recommended 
vibration noise is predominant had bought the first one and replaced to find out if this problem with the first device but even the second one has his issue noise disturbance when the sound is bit high otherwise the performance is better 
this tiny mono speaker is good to listen soft music like classical melody pop when listing to rock music and bass boosted song it sounds flat the lows are not good build quality is good and connectivity has no problem its loud when playing at max volume the sound is clear even at high volume as this is mono speaker with mm driver will not get the woofing effects 
using it for months without any issue sound quality is awesome volume can reach at quite high level 
build quality is good sound is awesome battery is not bad overall the product is paisa wasul hai
i feel relief during listening

small in size but big in sound its just inch but amazing audio quality very good by at this price
like got this great brand at very good discount dislike even at the highest value level the sound can only be heared from close distanne cracking also at this level sounds starts to crack overall does the basic and immediate job of sound amplification by taking the sound to next level only buy it at great deal not worth the mrp 
it sounds very good very portable and ruget the buttons are little difficult to use but overall an excellent product the sound can light up even big hall
best audio quality even amplifies low amplitude sound bit heavy sound but very clear and high n ratio of db bluetooth connectivity is very stable all buttons works well nice grip on slippery surfaces build quality feels strong and premium

build quality is good nice grip and easy to holding battery life is very good it takes just little time to full charge sound quality is beyond expectations like this speaker very much 
i was bit disappointed at the first sight of the product as it looked too small than imagined but my disappointment was over as soon as heard it its sound is much bigger than its size its overall good handy speaker 
excellent sound and easy to set up and use my year old now adjusts sounds easily

excellent product compact and durable using more than months no problem noticed and sound quality is outstanding
jbl sound quality is good and as per the size it is working fine battery is also good but you will not get wow experience 
luvd the colour sound quality is very good
you can get better than this at this price use it for music and for conference calls as well it aorks absolutely fine 
the best and cute speakers have seen and heard in my life the battery life is amazing
suprb product jbl below design is satisfying bluetooth connectivity so fast and good bole to paisa wasool yar
meets my expectation if corners were slightly rounded it would have been easier to carry catches signals from long distance decent material sound quality is good bass seems to be on the lower side good travel companion no doubt 
wo wo wo product really jbl keeps its promises jbl is one of the great kings of the sound world this bluetooth speaker is really worthy to cost 
its good but the sound is not very loud 
best bluetooth speaker in this range the sound is just awesome sound quality is superb go for it blindly jbl brand for reason by harman
the sound it produces is remarkably and surprisingly loud compared with the size though it does not produce the quality bass effects but considering the size the sound quality is crystal clear the battery output is good as it last for around to hours which is more than satisfactory if you want to listen to the music on your laptop or on the mobile this product will surely exceed your expectation 
i don know got duplicate problem or what but after days of using it can say the sound is so not worth the money there are better sound speak speakers are available 
it is unbelievable unless you see it and use it such small device about inch inch inch can produce such loud clear and high bass sound this is technological marvel have watt rms home theatre philips system watt rms logitech system watt rms fenda system this is only watt rms but sound output is fantastic and at this price point this is just steal it is so small that it will fit your palm or go inside your pocket but still produces amazing sound 
product is no doubt awesome but the dimension not match with website and with the product physically size of the website shown the dimension 
aswome packing have received yesterday first impression was good nyc packing delivery also good best at rs recommend
been using it over months have good experience with it so far good sound quality good battery worth every penny
battery backup is very nice sound quality also nice 
nice buil super portable great balance of bass abd treble 
using this speaker since nearly one year and the sound quality is excellent charges really quickly and charge holds for quite long usage good product and m happy with my purchase
good speaker for the price though use it infrequently but it performs well retains charge over period it is light and easy to carry
this is my second speaker first one my friend liked lot so gave it to her superb sound quality very happy with it strongly recommended 
very nice looking forward for more such products
very good speaker have tried various small ones but this one definitely is the most robust and value for money including good base sound 
its very handy to carry along during travel battery backup is pretty good when you listen at medium vol level had to compromise with the sound quality apart from that its good product 
really very good speaker amazing sound with its cute little size sound look and feel size 
the whole product is good have seen it in my friends house liked it and purchased for myself 
amazing sound solid build quality looks cool jbl worth the money 
superb
best but price is high in great india sale its price is it is best price 
it very nice and good battery backup love it sound if you are good music listener then it needs to charge daily other wisr it last to days for me 
nice product and easy to use
for the money these do their job well sound bit like vintage radio sets powerful phone speakers 
i liked this jbl go very much its good and worthy product enjoying my moments with good music with jbl go
got it through prime and was delivered to me within days packing was fair and the product is truly satisfying looks small but when music is played in full volume the music can be heard from meters away 
the thing is until you do not have these speakers you would think your laptop speakers are okay and would do the job but as soon as you use these regularly you will hate your laptop speakers bass is tight enough for the price and punchy mids are clear and precise highs are detailed but loses integrity at higher volumes there is bit of distortion on the highest and step below that but who listens that loud connectivity is decent and can connect seamlessly upto meters without any wall glass in between battery life is great and can last for around to hours on single charge there is no better bluetooth speaker at this price range totally recommended 
good product
very good speakers when properly connected the sound quality is pretty good and loudness is also enough sometimes bluetooth connectivity creates problem and speaker needs to kept at some distance from mobile for proper connection 
sound quality is good even though its only wt but bass is low in full volume sound is not so smooth but overall value for money
got second one this time nice sound quality love it
it is real good speaker with good connectivity and output is also impressive 
wonderful it is well running into its nd year 
i have been using for last years it is really amazing good sound quality it really compact 
sound quality is very good considering the price and size of the speaker battery backup could have been little better overall good speaker for small to medium room 
packing was good built quality is excellent but after months am noticing battery performance reduced to hr sound is awesome for small room 
i am reviewing this after using this product for more than years apart from some battery issue recently this kept me entertained for long years 
it is best for tv shows and movies but for high beat songs it is not suitable best ever for mobil calls
good product its compact product bluebooth coonect easily sound quality is good for small room go for higher version if usage is for bigger room 
sound quality is good only problem is volume which is not much works well in small room though 
nice sound looks nice easy to use for this price range it the best can get absolutely satisfied
nice product but usb charging jack length is very short bass is good sound is ok if have one usb port for pendrive then it would be best option for travel 
this little box has amazing sound quality in this price it is worth penny it can travel anywhere you travel due to its portability and it gives upto hours of charge am using since an year there is no damage just go for it
excellent product liked it used it with echo works perfectly fine for its size the sound volume is excellent

am writing this after months and months of usage hesitated to buy jbl go instead of jbl go after buying it no hesitation it satisfied the expectations sound quality and bluetooth connectivity is good and holds prety much sufficient battery run time 
i very happy the sound clarity was awesome worth of money and gud quality don have any complents ill suggesting this one go jbl
it has fair amount of bass and the treble is at parr the lows as said by many is not that significant the competitors either crack at high volume or have very low volume output well this product has sweet spot and is good buy 
very good prodact long time charge sweet sound 
nice product good sound bass is clear battery life is long lasting sound do not tear apart at loud noise easily connect with bluetooth device one can easily go for it

good sound clarity pairing is easy only problem is it gives echo to people on the other end of the line when on phone call other than that great product am using it in our office for conference calls works nicely until the echo comes echo does not come always it comes once in calls 
small but incredibly powerful brilliant for the price got it been looking for powerful speaker at reasonable price and this is it 
love the sound quality it handy enough to carry wherever you want to go you just have to switch it on and connect the bluetooth jbl 
pros good sound clarity no distortion even at high volumes small and compact design very light weight really portable bluetooth connectivity is seamless and range is good loud enough for single room cons bass could have been bit better although this does justice to its cost buy it if you are getting it under 
will be smaller than you expect will sounds way louder than you ever expect sound quality is amazing build quality is great

amazing product
great product and good value for money 
bluetooth connectivity is really awesome sounds quality is good battery power is also good if you want to use it in small room or in car like me just go for it 
just one word wow have purchased after listening to my couple of frnds jbl and it proved itself wow
good sound quality for the price range some other brands give much better feature for the same price and quality
gifted this to my sister and she loves it it has better sound quality and bluetooth connectivity 
build quality is good tiny but makes more sound felt sound quality could have been better this is my first bt speaker so can not compare with other bt available in market but for the price paid am satisfied with product 
good quality sound quantity average to good owing to price most widely sold
for the price paid this provides adequate listening experience with very decent sound quality that is well balanced and clear the highs and mids are articulated well the bass is also present and noticeable but do not expect rumbling deeps and thumps this is not the speaker for that its perfect speaker for casual music and for browsing youtube videos and tedx lectures this is definitely not my pick for serious music sessions or for group listening this is strictly for personal use only for better music quality combined with portability ll pick hk onyx series 
the product is very good and the sound quality is amazing 
very good product for everyone 
jbl go sound quality is ultimate it is easy to use and keep everywhere it battery life also good it just osm product 
still working good had purchased this product on jan e months
got the product within working days nice bass and good sound also it original product have got it registered from jbl india official site 
go for this speaker without any second thoughts it has been more than year since bought this and there have been no issues with the speaker so far the sound quality is excellent the bass effect is commendable and the battery lasts quite long as well in terms of look and feel the product is quite sturdy too 
it really good for listening to music with decent sound effects
i want to tell one thing everything is superb except charging charging is not up to mark 
nice
overall the product is good and in this budget this speaker is the best battery life is good material is very fine and finishing is great the only drawback is the lack of usb micro sd point and fm radio 
worst experience why people gave stars was cheated with these ratings sound base is not good satisfied delivery is on time 
got the pink variant no that not gay and was struck by how much the colour popped when got it the blue light is nice contrast to the pink overalls jbl is tried and tested brand and this tiny speaker screams jbl on both its faces and also in the sound it produces sufficiently loud with good bass yes yes we played despacito electro swing that listen to is pretty taxing on speakers but this one seems to be taking it like champ battery life could ve been better but compromises have to made for speaker this small and priced so low we would all love tiny speaker with woofer like bass and battery that lasts all week but that not reality in the capitalist world we live in would buy again 
best product and best quality
the delivery was in time good sound quality good for small room you will really enjoy it must buy
nice product
i love this speaker and it is very portable sound quality is good it is bluetooth connected
too good sound it pretty loud and also clear enjoying it 
it has everything needed from speaker love the sound supports all my mobile devices
best compact bluetooth speakers 
very convenient good sound good battery life
happy with the product value for money 
good things come in small packages this speaker just goes on to prove the point compact speaker with superb sound quality the clarity of sound doesn crack even on full volume bluetooth range is pretty decent look and feel of the product is really sturdy what more to say will sum it up by saying that jbl go is definitely more than value for money and must buy for people who travel lot 
i amazed by the quality of sound this small device produces the base is slightly higher to my taste would have rated it better if it had an onboard radio next previous buttons but for these this is an amazing product 
this speaker is everything wanted at the best price the colour is so attractive ve taken it along to house parties and picnics the size is just perfect m happy with the sound quality and battery life as well 
overall satisfied sound clear and loudness just ok for private listening buy only if needed to take speaker on travel otherwise nothing great 
very good and long lasting battery
i bought it for my daughter and mom as they listen to songs on their phone it is good for that purpose sound quality is ok ok not very good but not bad either good for room sound on maximum volume is not good although would have wanted better one but for the budget buyers think it should be ok do not have experience of other products in the same price range so cant really compare 
an amazing purchase totally worth the money
very ppor quality product one the buttons are too shallow to be easily accessible volume is pretty low when compared with philips bt the products sleeps off to save battery and needs to be reconnected everytime no autoconnect mechanism 
has very good sound compare to its size use this for outdoor workout in our park 
i absolutely love my jbl go have no complaints at all the design the sound quality and the battery life everything is amazing 
at first hadn liked it but gradually became fervent lover of its sound quality now when listen directly through mobile feel the song stripped and soon connect to this little perfect device thanks amazon for such discount and also to jbl for making good product like this 
awesome product but the rate is product vise so high it should be between is worth 
good product easy to carry with wherever go the sound quality is amazing however at times it loses contact with the device on bluetooth
good sound quality even after year 
good product and sound is also good
i ve bought so many of these even gifted it to people and told many others to buy it too easy to carry good sound quality 
the product is of good quality and good value for money the speaker turns off automatically when the device is idle for some time which saves its charge good feature 
amazing stuff so happy to have this at home have stopped watching tv and listen to songs
nice one
loud and good
very good build quality awesome quality sound and audio production battery life is yet to be experienced 
awesome sound quality with good amount of bass volume is also quite high battery backup is great too nothing to complain except one thing that the box doesn include an aux cable other than that everything is great 
this is the speaker am waiting for all these years the sound clarity is crystal clear worth the money
very good product
sound quality does not stand by the name loud distortion free sound can compare with the less reputed brands 
awesome luved the product by amazon good product for some days after some days may face battery issues
very clearly the day got really expected may be lot but then jbl speaker and let me mention it clearly again an original jbl speaker should or may be would sound to be really crisp and clear now please for damn don say that for rs want more original bose or so to say bowers and wilkins or something of that cadre but man the clarity jbl speaker would and should always have it don go on my english here just try to understand that it seems not much real and that what am more concerned about local vendor next to my house even if known to may sell me d and for once that can be clear with the logics but on amazon which has all state of art testing and ratings should check to it may be wrong here but peeps very clearly feel its not real and somewhat close to it which is good but then giving us the feeling of real and playing it fake well that hurts yeah emotions are tough but then lets not get private and into friendzone side and be practical and ask the vendors that bhaiya original de do yar thode aur paise le ke kudos 
excellent product
one of the best bluetooth speaker at this price range if you want this product go for it
liked the product but not satisfied with the packaging had received used product for the first time so replaced it later when received the replaced one it had damaged package wondering if it will affect the performance so far nothing had happened speakers are quite durable is guess speakers are good very handy you can take them anywhere and do not require any carry bag they fit easily in your pocket sound is awesome quite loud for this price range best option for small and portable speaker 
its been an year still its working best no complaints very much durable happy with the product quality its best value for money 
great product recommend to buy it

there is no exceptional doubts it is the best speaker d ever experience 
good product working good super bass and sound perfect for home and outing 
the speakers are well built ultra portable and provide decent sound output being small driver it lacks bass significantly this should not be considered as some serious sound machine however the product is quite cheap as compared to other oems though provides decent sound 
excellent love the sound quality 
cons good sound quality good treble color looks stunning connects easily pros bass not remarkable but good as per budget
an excellent product from jbl quite satisfied with the amazon delivery and product performance sound quality is exceptional both at high and low volumes 
a superb product with amazing audio quality packs punch and one can clearly listen to each and every beat of the song clearly

excellent speakers for its size and the money inbuilt mic makes it awesome you can attend phone calls while playing music best value for money don expect great bass quality of sound it good 
ok to hear facebook and whatsapp videos can use for youtube also but not upto the level to speak phone calls mic is not so clear to hear our voice by the opposite caller other than that quality of material and battery are so good 
cute tiny in size but big in sound and good k jbl go can not match the performance of lg ph so if you want to buy go with lgph that price drops to k oftenly

it is very good but have one problem it worked hours properly after discharged it does getting charge give me any solution

best speaker ever if you want bluetooth portable speaker and your budget is so please increase little bit buy this jbl go loved it 
the sound quality is good and the price is not so high but when we are connecting different laptops mobile one after another it is requiring to pair everytime we connect 
sound ohh jbl rock mindblowing battery backup is also good earlier had plan buy logitech which of my friend has but the decision to go jbl go really worked everything iz outstanding especially when connect call with it crisp and clear voice 
good performance but sound quality need improvement drastically 
jbl product is awesome it has amazing sound battery backup is nice as well it can give you to hours non stop music play just one problem faced sometimes switch on off button does not work well it gets time to on and off that is only problem if you are looking wireless speaker then guys go for it 
my experience one of the best speaker only for indoors not for outdoors bought this product at affordable price it a good bluetooth speaker works like charm connects seamlessly with my laptop and mobile phone sound quality is good the bass and loudness is average loudness in outdoor is below average definitely not recommended for outdoor use only buy this product if you are looking for budget bluetooth speaker and using it indoors products come with variety of plug in spot such as for mobile headphone and the speakers are very cool in looking no doubt about it and has mic in it overall experience with this is above average no problem and the product is reliable for listening musics at home

simply the best bluetooth connectivity is excellent sound is ok 
ultimate product to buy for home office and any occasion handy and light weighted
sound quality is the best ever with jbl bass is also very good bluetooth connectivity is very good easy to carry value for money product 
excellent product connectivity is fast and easy material and sound quality also good no complaints as of now 
good sleek design quality output
it is an excellent product at this price range was bit confused between the two speaker that is boat stone and jbl go that which speaker should buy but selected this speaker because love to listen vocals and music more than the high bass music it vocals are very loud and clear but you might get little bit disappointed if you are bass lover finally concluded that its build quality and sound quality is amazing but it is not water resistant that the weak point in this 
i feel hp bluetooth speaker is much better than this which have used before jbl have been using this for past one year battery life hp is much better than jbl bluetooth connection both are same sound and quality go with hp portability jbl is good since it is rectangular shape where hp is cylindrical
so small yet does the job of full music system super happy but where do get the google play music from 
i am writing this review after one day usage looks wise not good looking like old radio battery back is very poor sound quality is good but there no base quality which is disappointed me if your budget is low and don want extra bass then pretty good deal otherwise go for other brands don expect much in this budget 
excellent
what power packed speaker for its size and price absolutely amazing must buy for anyone looking for good bluetooth speaker 
it is best in the market at this price connects easily sound quality is just awesome everyone at my home is in love with jbl go 
amazing product can say of wonderful product very compatible to hand we kept in our pocket easy to carry base is awesome and the sound quality is brilliant worth to buy obvious great deal
a worth it product gifted friend he found is really useful not good for big hall because bass is bit low sound clarity is awesome can be used for movie watching small party in house in hostels mic can be attached to the speaker code one and can act as loudspeaker 
as always amazing sound quality and crystal clarity best in the market 
this was an awsome product when got it delivered and case is opened at first felt disappointed the product is so small but when connected bluetooth wow the sound quality was awesome

one of the best purchases from amazon 
i personally happy with this product and it has good quality sound if you just want it for indoor purpose
very very nice one of best product
a great product good for gifting fairly speaking it is not huge speaker but it does good job in small room worth the price 
jbl has yet again stood up to its name an awesome quality product at medium price range 
my room surround on super sound and bass 
i bought this after reading many amazon reviews which stated this as the best pick in this segment while can partially agree with that still feel that it is definitely overrated the sound quality was very very average which is very similar to that from an d speaker which costs lot cheaper the audio is clear but hardly there is any bass there is no passive radiator for bass the festive deal price was around rs but still feel it as overpriced may be just for the brand jbl if you are seriously looking for good quality sound output with some decent bass then this speaker is not the one to consider 
best product ever used using for yrs straight hrs daily no issue is sound till date only the battery backup lows down after year and half but not much after yrs it also starts picking yup rust overall best speaker to buy it won disappoint you ever
nice small packet big sound easily covers one room and others too but good for room can call awesome too after all jbl 
it is quite portable with good bluetooth connectivity sound varies depending upon the sound from the respective website 
simply awesome 
this is the best wirless bt speaker in this price can buy it for its sound quality class looks best option thanks 
great product 
budget product sound quality is awesome small in size of easily carryable
the product is really good
the speaker is very handy and the rubberized finish is really good the sound unexpectedly is quite loud and clear bass is ok can complain at this price range felt slight distortion when on full volume but nothing much noticeable to volume is most of the time enough for an average size room easily gets paired with my ipad laptop and phones no issues there 
good product and beware of duplicate while taking ok
i purchased this product very recently just love the sound quality was playing songs on jbl on my daughter birthday and kids were dancing and enjoying the music hats off to jbl for such wonderful device

nice product and nice bass sound this jbl product 
very good huge sound output with extreme quality battery charge stays long even while days continues use
great sound for such small piece good for hikking and trekking trips nice back up good ergonomic body and nice matte finish easy to connect 
it fits on the palm of your hand they are super loud at max volume but won be too loud in noisy or croudy place jbl is well known for it speakers with the balanced bass and volume would recommend everyone who wants decently loud speaker with the perfect bass in reasonable price to go ahead for this speaker 
a must buy type things it is don believe the size its truly just same as the size of your palm but sure that its sound will blow your mind loved it superb quality

the product looks quite handy compared to the quality and the level of sound perfect for carry on and smaller outdoor settings worth buy 
i bought this product at rs and really love this product as its built quality is awesome and so does its sound quality and clarity 
the speaker is good worth of your money you will not get depressed after purchasing the speaker as all know everything has merits and demerits too demerit is if play ha song full of bass the song will go plan but on normal songs bass is good the last thing by my suggestion go for it

this is good product but the sound quality not found to be great its easy to use and good connectivity not sure about the other things since got this week back
sound quality is best as brand name bluetooth connectivity is just meter battery life is averagly to hours design 
you won believe the power that emanated from this little wonder at least didn at this price range was settling for just mere bluetooth speaker but this product surpassed expectations with pretty good vocal rendering it would be awesome to have comprehensive bass but guess with what one getting one couldn ask for more extremely happy also delivery by amazon was on point the product reached me before the expected date 
very good sound quality lovely colour and easy to carry bass is well put

overall it cute and good
i haven tried any other bluetooth speaker except jbl go everything is good including sound quality built quality battery back up and connectivity though to buy boat rugby or mi however believe on trusted brand jbl and its amazing go for it 
for its size it plays really loud sound quality is very good build and material quality is also good and does not feel cheap single charge lets you play for almost hours at volume so the battery life is also impressive note all above comments are considering the speaker size it can easily fit on your palm and can be an excellent companion while travelling

this speaker sucks have used jbl flip and soundsticks by harman so know about sound this portable speaker is useless and not loud and not clear it is much better to go for fenda swan as it deliver richer low end and better mids also the sound signature is wide and surrounding also it has micro sd and much better sound stage choice is yours

no portable speaker can match with jbl very light very sturdy very good backup using from past months great sound with bass 
it definitely not that great there are many other options out there go for better one for sure 
i say that if you have not decided yet please go ahead and buy it immediately this is actually the product that entertained me lot you may carry it while traveling battery backup is good if you play it with middle sound

it jbl by that it given that it gonna be awesome the size is juz perfect taking into consideration the size don expect the sound quality of boom box all from this but for the money you pay it worth it only small complaint the paint on the front grill tends to go off after while so be careful when you choose the colors

amazing as of now yeah the bass ain good at very high volumes the voices start to separate but for the amount e bucks it a really good speaker connects to anything everything and amazing battery hear my videos and songs on it it still lasts good to hours for me have using it for days till now am happy with it 
logitech x is far better than jbl go in all aspects like cost quality battery bass etc the only additional feature in jbl go is call answer mode which dont feel very imp and if this feature doesnt matter then surely go logitec x at much reasonable cost 
its an amazing product going by the reviews just ordered it without even single thought it met all my expectations though one would be surprised by the size of the speaker sound quality is really awesome 
a cute nice well built bluetooth speaker with great sound and long back up value for money product the bass is not quite high but with its size it is justified

awesome speaker didn expect this level of sound from this small device mic has performs and hence giving stars

it really good for the price the bass is pretty okayish but cannot expect more for the price 
the only portable speaker you need great value lightweight incredible big sound classic jbl 
the product is simply amazing didn expect such good sound from such small box the voice clarity is off the charts must buy 
for a single room its really great product while working on laptop you can listen music or while workout you can play music sound quality is really good only problem see if you connect to android phone and then if you try to connect it with your laptop even its not connected to phone but paired with phone it will not connect cause you have to unpair it first from mobile device and vice versa

bought it as gift for friend and she loves it it been month since the purchase and it works fine so far obviously don expect it to be very loud as the loudness range is less than jbl flip but found it perfect for at hostel single person usage the colours are cute and it comes with cable to charge but there wasn any stamped warranty card nevertheless m sure amazon handles that it very much portable and easy to carry 
this is the best speaker in such at such good price sound quality is amazing far better than what you can expect from such small piece this is definitely worth buying buy from the seller cloudtail it is the best had got duplicate piece earlier from dealscart but returned it got new one 
only when you go full volume the sound goes little blur output is superb battery life is good 
great speakers the sound quality is amazing easy to carry at high volume it is enough to cover entire room best speaker at this price go for it

jbl is super good brand and so is this product however kind of wish there was bass adjustment

small footprint good sound good looks invisible speaker with built in microphone very good for hands free calls 
i ve got this in flash sale for inr and it more than worth it audio is crisp and deep base output with small form factor 
best bluetooth portable speaker with mic sound quality is really awesome
got it in though there were other options available in lesser price but decided to go with the brand jbl and must say m happy with the product body touch and feel is very nice it has rubber finish all around bluetooth connectivity range is good enough for home sound quality could have been better but cannot expect more at this range 
wow wat sound jst as expected very happy with the purchase people go for it amazing product do portable
good product
the product is excellent when it comes to sound quality connectivity and portability in this range getting all three in one product is just amazing have been jbl user for very long time and can assure you that you will not regret buying this at all go ahead and buy it without any further doubts 
does everything its supposed to do compact portable decent performance durable battery good purchase overall 
i am using it from last years and it working just great till now the bass is so cool that you will love it and you can even take call from this cool device love it going to buy jbl now
this is the second time have bought it first one gave to my brother it is good for the price bought at during sale 
jbl as the brand suggests is quite good product played it continuously for hours without charging the sound quality is good too good buy in all edit after years of usage it is still going strong and playing too good 
sound is loud and base is normal battery backup is good too but do not expect too much base bought is for just and it is perfect in this price range
jbl is trustworthy brand always it is like small cracker and big sound 
the audio for an enclosed space like room is superb and it delivery premium bass when ke pr in suitable environment and its contact design attracts attention and allowed you to carry it anywhere jbl is awesome at this price range
one of the best portable bluetooth speaker bought during amazon festival taken it allover india and it have proven it durability
everything is good but the bass is bit low value for money if you are highly interested in bass sound go with high end model
good speaker value for money got it at the great amazon sale 
great product at this price on pros good sound quality cons battery life
jbl go has exceeded my expectations the sound clarity is superb the built is small enough to fit in pocket and the battery life is amazing been using it for month and it has been one of my best purchase in amazon 
it works very well for ftxft room sound quality as well as product built is good have also used it for attending calls for hands free meetings 
one of the best product available in this price range worth the money spent 
i got it for rs sound quality is not as my expectations but think best at this price 
the speakers are loud and clear despite of its small size the quality of the sound is so good and clear that for small to medium rooms will feel like r sitting inside the recording studio 
tried for couple of days battery still working you can move the phone quite far and still works nice design but personally don like the big logos front and back didn try calls yet good product overall
for such small size the sound is beyond expectations the clearity is great it is loud enough for big room no issues with connection for bluetooth as well as aux cable but as per my experience the sound quality is better when played on bluetooth one thing which gave me super surprise is that if tlyou use it as mic recorder to record your voice it works really fair interns of quality 
best speaker in this price rank no one beat sound of jbl product best product m happy to buy it but only minor problem found that it does not give good backup
there is no option you must have great one for the beach holidays stay with song 
i try many portable wireless speakers but this is great for personal user pro light weight compact size look attractive con not great bass in full volume sounds quality not great 
absolutely stunning performance it also works as hands free for handling mobile calls
wow its awesome nice sound quality nice bass treble is little bit weak overall its great today received this and happy with product lets see what happens in months
great speaker with excellent sound quality reviewing after months still no problem at all great battery life love it rectangular shape 
perfect product 
very good product bass is awesome sound clarity is insane also it scores in looks 
sound as ensured by the brand jbl expectations met high volume just as in car stereo worthy 
awesome product just loved it it produces awesome bass with quality sound it is must buy product
if r on budget then go for it nice sound quality got for rs during offer

after advance payment items delivered within days actual product size is very small but as per image it show very good sound quality is ok not the worth of aprx k avoid to by from amazon 
nice solid body shock resistance and the sound is great have tried mane speakers but at this price bracket this is one of the best thought the zook rocker looks good with the leds and all 
i am using this product for months now am writting some pros about this the sound quality is pretty good the battery life is also awasome the bass is pretty average bluetooth connectivity is very strong now am writting some cons about this product the charging time approximately hours the charging light indicator does not work properly although this is the best value for money product

i happy with my jbl small room portable speakers beacze its sound quality and easily handling product with travelling life battery backup is also great its look like unique simple and small attractive product with fabulous sound quality

they are awesome use them all the time battery life is sometimes an irritant as it lasts hrs max but overall it small and loud and awesome 
it an amazing product one must go for it with price factor compare to philip its highly better as the price is approximately same 
awesome speaker laud clear sound fast bluetooth connectivity bass also very well superb battery backup suggested must bye this sound in k

good product but have to be careful coz its soo cute that it got stolen have to order one 
awesome speaker sound is good battery life is also impressive before buy saw the comments where mentioned it is jot good but bought it and am happy to say it is good speaker my friends are also impressed with its sound 
go for it no doubt it is the best bt speaker under am using it since years and am satisfied with it tiny bomb and if you are looking for best bt speaker under you should go for logitech x
sound quality very nice
wow cool crisp hearing in relaxed state of mind five stars 
sound quality wise feel its ok however the sound is enough loud the small in size is the best thing about it the connectivity is also upto the mark 
everything is good tuff body best sound quality great battery life charging cable is available in package only adapater is not available 
excellent product 
awesome quality product is sound quality too good battery backup also best in comparison to same series speaker best for home usage 
it is not loud enough the highest volume is almost as high as my phone speaker would rather spend little extra and buy better speaker with high volume 
it nice about it sounds it awesome and battery life it is nice but when ever we using in higher sound the battery life it couldn be stable for hours it will be maximize atleast hr or hr but iam truly satisfied with jbl go thankyou jbl
it really good product didn expect the sound to be that good looking at its size but really useful product
jbl harman known for quality and this product proved it again nice packing crisp conventional design and sound quality worth its price lacking in bass is the only concern but think in such small size and price what jbl is providing is worth its price would recommend to buy this and only this as compared to other hell lot of similar available on the shelf missing fifth star just for bass 
jbl this name is everything for me bcoz m music lover purchase it for my baby girl of month who also like music everything in this speaker is perfect size is suitable for pocket sound quality is awesome both in treble and bass few of customer reviewed that sound is not clear above its wrong m certified buyer so suggest to buy it without any doubt
sound quality is good for medium sized room it is good 
totally satisfied with the product good sound quality after all it jbl boss and last but not the least super fast delivery from amazon thanks 
great sound quality battery backup is good portable easily connect with windows phone also handy moderate sound solved my purpose as dont like the sound to be too loud value for money loved the colour
this is the best speaker for such cheap price cant believe it would sound so good if you are looking for something cheap and something that still sounds good wouldn say amazing but its clear loud and has great sound 
this is great buy it compactness and design is what makes it so portable the battery life is satisfactory sound quality could be bit better though purchased the teal color which looks great no complains so far 
amazing product sound quality is superb only battery drains fast so have battery otherwise overall its an great product
the best speaker in its range has sound quality better than speakers worth was pleasantly surprised on hearing the volume and quality of sound on hearing it for the first time 
great experience with jbl go perfect sound quality and enough to enjoy music all together battery backup is lesser as compare to boat of same price category 
the sound quality is great with decent bass and treble am totally impressed by the body of the speaker as was expecting some plastic kind of thing but it is soft kind of rubber feeling material and special mention amazon as it was delivered well before the expected date thumbs up 
this is really good and perfect product economical and just the right 
great product at this price range bass is pretty great and you be amazed how loud it sounds like at full volume 
it sounds awesome with fantastic noise level but totally disappointed with the colour in order pictures its shown as occur green but in real its different its fade green actually 
sound quality is amazing battery life is little not pleasing mean battery stay till hrs in little wordss small packet bada dhamaka 
sound is clear and perfect bass is bit less liked the product battery life is bit less sound reduces as battery reduces worth it money
so being of great confusion before buying this product think everyone who likes reading review before buying product would like to know about this speaker if they re comparing it to others first of all it has great value for money in comparison to the sound quality and pocket size speaker it has loud enough sound not party speaker though it would be loud enough for an average sized room recommend it to anyone who would like portable speaker with cheap price and good quality ordering another one for my brother as it is product that everyone deserves to have 
nice jbl speaker sound like awesome thanks amazon 
one of the best thing bought from amazon the package quality was optimum am using since last months and not single issue best suitable for indoor use at last it is worth

easy to carry as it is very small clear sound but bass is poor slightly overrated other brands are also available with the same price but with better specifications consumers should compare properly and then decide 
giving stars coz better than expected nice sound sounds better in small rooms or less occupied halls bass is good 
you can question jbl it perfect 
very convenient to carry best sound clarity every beat comes clearly can be used for parties too the out side material is kind of rubber it protects the device from accidents damages just go for it you will love it 
nice product for peace of mind but purchased it for times and in both time st product is not good then replace it ones
i used this product years ago then lost it in move decided to replace it with another bluetooth speaker in the same range because wanted to try something different that is when learnt all that can possibly go wrong with device of this size and functionality had taken the goodness for granted with jbl go the fact that its bluetooth connectivity is flawless that there this tiny beep that lets you know when it connected that there this light that blinks when it searching that the battery lasts ages and that the sound performance is out of this world it fills the room it performs at maximum sound and it delivers happiness am back with my ex bluetooth speaker and m never going exploring again unless it for really high end product ve never owned one thank you jbl for this understated glorious piece of perfection so much respect for your brand 
a perfect speaker with soothing music clarity not much loud not much low best use in travelling full charging time is hr battery life is hrs in medium volume if go for high thn its hrs nd yes it is worth buying for me my experience is good with this gadget point is that you can connect big music box or dj speakers too via aux cable

one of the best product from one of the best brand 
 material quality good sound quality goo and battery life not yet decided
sound quality is good its not until you compare with other higher models that you feel that they have better sound quality but this is very good cheap alternative using for almost years now and no complaints have taken it on several trips
good sound good bass and looks also good
good things come in small packages perfect for listening to my daily dose of devotional music in the mornings and rock in the evenings good range of sound reproduction jbl brand lives up to it reputation happy 
it is better than your tv inbuilt speaker it is loud enough to wake up your neighbours vocals are clear and it sounds like big speaker am using it for my laptop to watching movies and yes am satisfied only cons is it has little bass hope this is helpful 
this jbl speaker is pretty awesome sound quality is pretty awesome but its life expectancy is lower than expectation 
good product
if you are looking for speaker with usability for one person or one room go for it jbl has always been delivering me it quality and no wonder this time too the bass and treble both are balanced sound quality is optimum for variety of genere eg rock classical old pop etc 
no more words about this jbl it fantastic but thought there is bit reduction in sound after some days
sound qulity is very good
sound is really very good and loud just amazed that such small speakers can make such loud sounds bass is also good as expected of w speakers not so much but yeah comfortable worth the money bought if for best ever in this price range edit after months of usage it stopped working for some reason it wasn being turned thought battery issue but it didn turned on after charging for day then talked on harman jbl customer number and was amazed by the service they replaced my product at first they told me to visit service centre but as live far away in greater noida the service centre was in gurugram they said to courier the product on the service centre with reference id over it but then they called and also arranged pickup for me product was taken and within days recieved complete new jbl go they replaced my product completely m just amazed by the service of harman just buy it this product is too good
good product no blur in the voice

look jbl in this price range is giving good option no doubt material quality and surface finish is awesome sound is also good but for room and that too small but it suffices now coming to battery part charges fastly if have got turbo charger or fast charger but discharges also early personally think boat stone is awesome in all respects against this and that too at lower price rs in sale and boat stone is giving hrs playtime in real and awesome fast charge water proof solid design and what not and sound is awesommm

one of the best things to purchase great things in small package completely surpassed my expectations bought this on whim only to find that the sound quality is better than expected the build quality is better than expected looks better than expected and is easy to use 
its an awesome device to tune up ur music life the range of bluetooh is awesm the battery back up speechless playing for almost hrs at full volume still no sign of battery low basically about the sound which is the most mandatory specs to be discussed firstly baby its jbl the sound perfectionist diz small thing is beast in sound
unmatched quality till date
superb sound quality material quality is strong enough 
excellent product could have been little louder but enough for me
awesome speaker for the size easy to carry great music if r looking for bass or shakin up the room this is not for n its not meant to do that at this size price range decent battery life vibrant colors enjoyable experience
very clear and soothing output can fill one x room with comfortable sound used for week so far can comment on battery life right now 
though useful in inferior to moderate sound quality output sound is like mono not enough for music and quality sound lovers
this is really good works well but not exactly true for straight hrs of run time though some where near hr mins except that its good product 
good looks loud and clear at this price good battery life 
awesome in every way lives upto its name
very good product bluetooth functions well and sound too good to carry easily outdoor is as well good but the volume is not sufficient 
i like this product but what feel sound is not that high which it should be otherwise best product at this price with no cons 
does what is advertised and does it well sound quality is good enough for regular music enthusiasts small form factor bluetooth pairing works reliably battery life ok overall good value for money 
sound is not high but the sound clarity is good enough
nice product but not upto the expectation was expecting little bigger speaker with reasonable bass but this one is very small in size but loudness and clarity of sound is very good but don expect any good bass in this
pros compact fits into any pocket gorgeous colour green easy and quick connectivity buttons on top in body colour microphone makes calling so easy cons yet to find any great product good price go for it bingo 
amazing quality with clear bass med and treble loved it 
ok
what an excellent product palm sized has matte finish and looks very sleek performs excellent the speakers can go very loud for such small little thing however there is distortion of bass at really high volumes but that okay the only problem had was when the device was connected to my phone through bluetooth it would sometimes switch off by itself which did not happen with an aux cord would recommend 
the speaker works flawlessly however wish the bass and clarity was much more may be should have increased my budget bit the size of the speaker is very small 
woahh the tiny small but sounds and bass is load awesome product jbl rocks
great product nice sound quality and nice build the colour of the product is nice as well on the time delivery by amazon as expected 
superb quality speaker ordered red colour looks nice handy sound quality is good awesome bass overall it a decent product 
it a very nice speaker do go for it ll enjoy the music sound is very clear and it is quite high also to fill normal size arena with gud nd high volume 
build quality is up to the mark and the sound quality with respect to the cost is better that expected 
very good sound quality and delivery was also on time bought it three months before and its working very nice battery life is really amazing 
very easy to use and one touch connect makers could have worked on the bass lot of disturbance know this device is not for the ideal music listening but still could have done better 
its the cutest little thing love the sound after listening to it ordered another this time even cheaper
good product value for money the sound quality is very good for the size of the speaker

sound quality and battery backup good
bluetooth stops working not dependable although sound is good gave to use with aux

works good for small room little connectivity problem with macbook otherwise it is cool and small speaker and can be carried easily in pocket also 
easy handy lasts long and good sound quality one must ot expect too much out of it for its price if ur looking for something which is small and give good sound output this is the real deal
value for money speaker sound quality is good lacks bit of bass though but that okay keeping in mind it size and price optimum for casual use would have given it stars for it performance but had to lower my expectations from this speaker keeping im mind the price if you want superior performance like for parties and if you could spare few bucks then would recommend buying jbl flip but in this price range it a decent speaker 
sound quality connectivity is good 
material quality sound quality and battery life is really good 
i am happy with the purchase sound output is good considering the price

this product made me to write review for the first time on amazon very good product am delighted as customer thanks jbl

don think about it very much it is superb great and lots more product im really really satisfied after buying this speaker awesome sound quality also ordered nd one for my brother buy this at rs which is the cheapest think grab it 
super duper 
small but powerful can easily fill room with sound gives out good strong bass certainly worth the buy
the quality of the speaker is nice but when play music in full sound it delivers little distortion in the music otherwise the product is good and m satisfied with it 
it all what wanted awesome song clearity good base good battery backup automatically off if not paired till mins
when bought it thought that the sound would be not that great not it is too much loud for even medium sized room 
super product
it worked well for month now it shows very bad quality audio with more vibration
hello using this product from last year this is best speaker which am using blue tooth connectivity is also superb hassle free connection sound quality is also very good sound is loud and crisp suitable for medium size hall regards pritam 
loved it loved the color too only problem was the charger there should have been it own charger instead of just wire but product is nice let hope it lasts for long time 
this is the best speaker for the size its highs and mids are so clear and surprisingly the bass is so pure without any difficulties with the size it has and lastly worth the money coz purchased it for but can get on offers for like k or k so guys go for it coz its very much handy 
jbl is the beast louder than expected keeping in mind its size not to mention an awesome battery back up about hours in full sound and about hours in mild sound worth the price totally in love with this product 
excellent sound and compact size use this for my teleconference calls it really loud and super easy to connect 
amazing speaker was surprised by the sound quality and depth of sound go for it without second thoughts 
its very nice
truth be told m not much of techie person so if you re looking for really professional review using big terms and are looking for an opinion about this product in techie point of view don read this review however what review ll give you is my honest opinion on the product in normal persons point of view the sound quality of the speaker is excellent maybe not as good as bose or something like that but if you re looking for speaker for purposes varying from chilling with friends during sleepover or simple dance rehearsal then highly recommend this it is also very very light weight and easy to carry around for one have carried this in my pocket the colour ordered the hot pink one is bright and great if you want to make statement so if you leave it somewhere and forget about it someone will probably call you up and will also probably return it back to you because the pink is attractive and they ve noticed it or they might not you know they might just take it for themselves who knows so if you re looking for speaker to begin with then go for it buy it you ll love it 
easy to use smooth finish sound quality is good and decent battery life overall good buy though not much support provided by the website regarding warranty 
good to buy nice sound got for but next day they reduced the price to 
ultimate sound best for those who travel and love music worth buy as compare to other brands you won get this quality of sound in other bluetooth speaker after using around months am facing its automatic shutdown problem when played in full sound o vlc use connecting through mobile 
overall good 
satisfied given the price got for rs 
loud and clear ok bass minimalist design good battery backup charging wire very short companion for you in your lonely time worth every penny 
excellent pocket dynamites considering the size sound is awesome handsfree also works smoothly 
best product at best price
worth it long lasting battery small size nice music quality and affordable price makes it perfect buy when say nice quality means can expect much in this price range go grab it better in deal 
the sound quality is amazing it could be playing in one room and you can perfectly hear it from some other room the only significant problem is that the bluetooth range is short if the source device is in some other room the speakers might not catch signals well rest all great and it charges pretty fast
just perfect
its good product but for those who wants only sound quality not for those who like loud sound

this product is best sound quality is amazing love this thank you so much jbl give me this great product never seen like this speaker and sound quality 
the built quality is awesome sound is good but bass is not so strong and the clarity of sound is wonderful battery backup is good it works for around hrs after having hr charge 
one of the best clearest sound this damn thing makes my outdoor trips more dope and enjoyable but performance best in rooms bass booster 
the sound is awesome sometimes it got connection issues also gets automatically turned off buy recommended good for all occasions 
this product is just awesome for its price clear sounds that you could expect little bassy though for its size but is good enough for blind buy worth every penny
pros portable mini bluetooth speaker playtime of hrs after full charging amazing voice quality bass is perfect for the size infact better worth every penny you spend on it cons have not found any so far 
this product is small in size and big on quality never expected it to be so good bought one for my father as he needed small speaker for listening old songs without disturbing anyone else and was sceptical but the sound and the built is very fine it worth spending bucks and won disappoint you got one again for myself and it as good as the first one 
superb quality no noise or any distortion of any kind on full volume it a must buy for musicphiles 
the product is awesome with it unique style and built quality moreover the clarity of the sound is excellent the size of the product is small enough to carry in your pocket
superb product call button have also function of stop currently playing song by single press and next by double press
bakwaaa hai jbl ke naam pe mat lena kabhi bhi na aawaaz na base ek dum ghatiya hai 
excellent product beyond expectations lovely sound only thing couldn understand where is mic 
i am not satisfied with the product price and quality according to price of product is not contain wonderful quality 
nice looking sound quality and battery life is good enough 
amazing quality easy to carry sound qualtiy is amazing colour is also attractive
superb sound quality is awesome material is good jbl means quality sound thanks amazon for providing quality product
i bought this as birthday present for my sister and got great discount too it very cute and portable and the volume and sound quality is unbelievable thank you amazon for the quick delivery 
small and good sound
excellent product value for money but has sone issues in staying connected with bluetooth device esp laptops 
the speaker colour is really attractive and as per it size it is loud enough to be used in closed environment rather than in an open setting 
very handy very nice audio recommended 
nothing worth then this in this amount really jbl speaker are just awesome well manufacturing material selection is good overall good agronomy 
dont go by its size it is beast use it not only for music but also movies and just love the clarity and it output best bt speakers at this cost 
thankyou for giving such wonderful product at my doorstep no day without jbl sound quality portability everything is excellent we use jbl frequently in this heavy rain enjoy lot my children use during their studies to improve the concentration hear meditational songs after they go it is my full time partner in the kitchen thankyou so much 
yeah loved it sound was really good and worth money gives neat bass and treble and no disturbance so far can go for it 
overall good product but just that it could have been easier to use when you press the bluetooth button there should be light on indicating that the bluetooth is now on or in use similarly with the volume buttons we have to make do with the guess work 
one can carry it anytime anywhere battery life is good so many colours to choose from sound quality is undoubtedly awesome 
nice product but bass is not that great
excellent
well its been year since bought it it works like charm highly recommend it note dont go with the size ll suprised with the loudness clarity of sound 
this product is small but it has great power in its sound material quality is good and weighs in mid range according to the size sound quality is damn amazing hearing this was amazed looking at the size but such great power works really well 
simply awsm sound quality enriched with features very very compact handy love it recommendable 
excellent product from jbl really loved it it sound it compactness it a portable speaker made for music lovers it connectivity also very easy and fast it durable and will definitely recommend you to buy the best part is it has aux in put and mic which allows you to speak through the mic when attend phone call and it has really clear sound without any noise but one thing have noticed that it has very poor performance when comes to its battery it lasts hardly hrs when play nonstop music with loud volume but apart from that its fabulous product go for it 
very good and durable writing this review after somany months of usage before purchased some other bluetooth speakers and that all dead within months now am happy with this product 
superfast delivery almost in hrs this is just magic box dont judge looking at its size it has great sound quality and loudness its awesome only thing got the charger cable of different color 
it a surprise out of the box definitely nothing so compact can match this little box in terms of clarity and loudness have seen people talking about bias my personal opinion why to expect bais with this little thing it has acceptable bais anyways pros exceptional performance on music where multiple instruments are playing nothing mixes up battery hrs vocals 
its very good product sound qulity is also best packing is very gental thanks amazon 
expected bigger piece and great bass works well in small room for hall the sound is not enough
great product at it price point perfect for road trips 
superb speaker good sound quality maximum volume will shatter the sound battery life is great single charge will go for full day hrs plus is volume is not that high its difficult to change volume by pressing speaker as single press change track and long press will change volume 
in small package there small box the sound is awesome chotta pack bada dhamaka soo satisfied 
good product which have ever seen in any product it a good speaker no doubt about it buy it
got the product on time package was very poorly done still feel it was used product sold to me nevertheless when started listening to music it made me forget everything

i didnt know so much power could be packed in such small unit reasonably priced easy to handle must buy sound enough to fill any average room sound quality is also good
sound quality is great battery life is great 
superb
worth price works awesome
sound quality is not up to the mark rest everything is fine 
good sound quality everything is perfect but misses pendrive and sd card slots 
after one week usage feels awesome will write after months
totally worth each cent paid would highly recommend this product to people who are looking out for affordable speakers with high quality 
i love it so much amazing powerful sound in such small size it is perfect in everything but it just misses battery indicator that the only con can think about it would say it as money well spent on worthy item 
i had bought it for my phone and like this speaker and got same colour as shown in pic it works good
very good product
the sound quality bluetooth connectivity and portability performance are excellent 
is it too small compared to the picture shown in amazon but good sound bass effects 
i got it for rs during sale and for the price the sound m getting surprised me it actually quite loud if you re going to use it casually for music on the go or even to use the mic that comes with this device to speak to someone on the phone it great looks and feels quite premium too can find single negative about this product so far have been using it for week clarity and bass are decent mean it not going to beat your dedicated expensive stereo home theater any day but for the size and price the utility this offers is well worth it 
i mostly use this product when watching movies in my mobiles simply it superb good for this price jbl always rocksss

all good and working efficiently

pretty loud sound for such small size and the price is also reasonable but there are also few cons like the sound clarity is not great and neither is the bass but if you don have any problem with these two you have win win situation pretty nice product at such price range would have given five star if the bass had been little more boosted up bluetooth connectivity is great but the company doesn mention the range but it is quite easy to connect some may have slight problem since the name cannot be changed due to its small size it can fit in palm and is highly portable

the first sight of the speaker will send bad vibes but when it comes to performance it rocks pros good bass and treble good loudness form factor charge longevity cons looks could have been better 
the speaker is good but not too much loud sound quality is very good 
sound of jbl is awesome sound is critical clear never expected from such tiny thing sound will be so good battery life is also good m using the jbl bluetooth speaker seen last month till that everything is perfect

it is very good product the sound quality is very good it gets loud at high volumes and distort bit full volume but that is not needed my only issue is that there should have been casing with the product otherwise it is nice good rubber feel and is small then in pictures
great product

i ordered one for my office when had need to use something to get better output during team meetings it had decent microphone input and speaker output so it did my job out of the blue tried testing it for music and non conversational use it was amazing and next day itself ordered one for myself too enjoy taking it along with me while go for cycling and even clip it on my motorcycle to enjoy some music during rides material is quite sturdy so dont worry much about breakage protect from water though 
it loud enough compared it size and price but the bass is not that satisfying though perfect for an individual to listen 
i liked the product very much very good sound quality must buy it bluetooth connectivity is very good

great voice range and good bluetooth connectivity beautiful looks and feature good buy and worth the money it costs
i have ordered two speakers in which one have received in new packing and another have received in old packing which is seems that it used speakers
delivers great sound that what it supposed to less features compared to mi bluetooth speakers but no compromise on the sound quality 
jbl makes some top notch portable speakers do not mistaken sound clarity with bass bought boat stone more bass than jbl but its sound started to crack within couple of days and though it was louder than this returned it this jbl is definitely most superior sounding in below k range the red color looks fantastic too 
awesome speaker small yet powerful and clear please don expect great bass from it it not meant that for delivering good bass it palm sized and it does the job very well it a bit old now and there lot of new better small portable speakers available however for the price there is nothing to beat it 
worth for money go for it if really want decent bluetooth speker for medium room size best in its class
good bass sound and battery life 
facing problem with bluetooth connectivity all the time this is second one first bought black one that was awesome but this one has connectivity issue
excellent product it worth 
ok if you are buying for yourself then it is good it is portable which like most problems you can change songs from speaker as there is no button for changing song and the usb cable is very very short otherwise it is good
a good product with excellent sound and long battery life price is reasonable would like to suggest everyone to try this

in my opinion it is the best product for the price are you looking to buy good bluetooth speaker suggest you to buy this product am sure it will impress you really liked this product if this comparing to the boat bluetooth speaker it has more sound quality and battery than it it only need hour to charge it its music playing time upto hours it is light weight comparing to other products it weight is g you can use this product when you go to picnic its size is small but it gives you big sound it has very good sound quality it has one year warranty don buy cheap price bluetooth speaker buy this type of good bluetooth speaker 
jbl go is very good product from harman bought it on world music day it sound is good as it size sub bass is absent but it is okay for its size overall it very good portable speaker for its prize range 
worth your money really good product and good battery life good sound quality 
i have paired the jbl go speaker via bt with my amazon echo dot firstly the pairing is quite stable and does not disconnect too often more importantly the sound that this speaker reproduces is absolutely amazing it is much louder and clearer than the audio from my tv it is real pleasure to listen to music on this device at volume nobody would believe that the incredibly loud and crisp sound can emanate from such tiny speaker real must buy highly recommended 
purchased in and its compact speaker with great impact ideal for people who like to listen to music on high volume and at this price its the best 
good product sound quality and sensitivity is very good 
super at sound and amazing bass battery life is very good too 
i ordered this product thinking whether it would be good or not but trust me its amazing it is powwrful speaker for daily use unless you dont get duplicate product gets charged in about hours and plays for around to hours atleast very impressive from jbl and at good price 
it an amazing product in budget and also comes with the brand name which does the needful goes without the need to say that ut has brilliant sojnd quality 
awesome little sound machine it perfect for contemporary times however the charger could be improved on not as easy to use as the speaker itself 
this is the best available bluetooth speaker in the range have seen other speakers of this range but found this best got this at 
if you have loud listen music then don buy this product because this speakers sound is quality sound 
nice product with reasonable price 
excellent product from jbl really loved it connectivity pros bluetooth version make the connectivity very easy fast cons there is no password facility so it may bother to someone who love to personalize the things for me it not an issue other options for connectivity it has aux input and mic which allows you to speak through the mic when attend phone call portability it a portable speaker made for music lovers it very compact and light weight so very easy to port it anywhere and enjoy the music sound quality the sound quality of the speaker is excellent it base is able to full room completely it only w rms but sound output is fantastic color options ordered teal color it also available in different colors which are following teal yellow pink blue grey orange red black so nobody will be dissatisfied as there are many color variants choose the one which you love battery performance lithium ion polymer v mah battery is slightly weaker than other famous brands like bose amazon basic but it not big difference it gives up to hours battery backup with full volume it sufficient other brands give up to hours battery back with full volume so it not big difference until it matters to you best thing it takes only hours to charge it fully pricing price is genuine as per the quality other brands are also in the same price range so price is competitive finally can say it a must buy product 
it is small wonder big surprise in small box sound quality is awesome connects very easily with multiple devices battery life is also very good completely portable can be fit in jeans pocket

excellent clarity good battery life 
battery life is pretty good just charge it before bed and it stays the entire day tbh love it one of the best speakers at the best rate sound quality is too good 
i love jbl that it came home to me and it was definitely sane choice buying this unlike photronics whose service revert and product are pathetic jbl go is genius speaker with good quality sound and pretty funky pink color thanks jbl
amazing sound quality and definitely value for money however lacks on bass and lower notes overall good product for average music listeners 
it a good product however since it has only one driver do miss the stereo effect it does the job pretty well but feel should have opted for one with sound drivers 
lightweight great sound in terms of volume and clarity 
awesome bass experience background music sound is very clear love it and nice packing thanx amazon

amazon as always well packed timely delivered jbl go it maintain its name so well its more and months yet works fine no distortion at all it battery backup is also the finest seen so far no regrets trust me it the best product at its price and in specified space

amazing sound quality and intensity the bass is satisfying and it sounds better than the bulky and cumbersome speakers 
superb sound quality and is very light and portable also lasts quite bit per charge overall very nice product and would highly recommend it 
it can charge and play at the same time it is huge bomb in tiny size just make sure not to play in full volume if you are under an unstable roof edit recently my friend got boat stone it is so much better than jbl go jbl has upper hand is its compact size and lightweight but in the end personally like the crisp sound in jbl go edit am just loving it now use it with my laptop running ubuntu few minutes back was playing movie in vlc and when clicked the hangup button the movie paused

excellent product so compact sound quality is superb even minute sounds are discriminated well worth buy for k rupees so easy to connect am using this device in my car for attending voice calls it is very clear for that 
quality is good but it is good if you re using it in very small area you can at all hear the sound keeping the device in room and listening in your hall too small sometimes bluetooth connectivity issue comes but that is compromisable due to not of being on repetitive basis sound quality is good but recommenede for small living area
good worth it
amazing small beast only drawback it doesn show the charge remaining not even in mobile unlike my aux bluetooth use for car which cost only inr 
for long time was looking for bluetooth speaker and this one was just the one was looking for its sound quality be it the material quality it feels so premium at the price it just stands out for the kind of good product it is just that it would had been more good if jbl starts providing charging adapter also with the product and with the usb cable

it a small wonder speaker for to carry it wherever you wish to the music is not very loud but decent for small room environments it square box nature makes it one directional sound and not suitable for all around listening hope this review helps 
i bought it for my laptop and mobile good sound quality and more than enough volume for one room user battery life is more than hours as jbl mentioned but comparatively low backup than competitives or other brands at same prize good value for money 
amazing battery backup price is great since it is jbl sound quality is pretty good too

excellent speaker sound is very nice 
thanks
if anyone knows how to do good sound it jbl and they do not dissappoint with product in this size and price m writing this review after using this for almost year and boy is this amazing many mini portable speakers lack in delivering good sound that crisp and falter on the bass too but this baby is everything it loud as well if that what you re looking for really can fill up the space in party 
awesome speaker for personal room and portability sounds good with good bass and sound quality design is tough and rubber finish makes it resistant to scratches and smudges overall very good experience buying it enjoying the product 
quality is so much nice but thought that the product will be big in size but it is small bass is also go liked the product very much
very good sound loud and clear paired easily with my mobile we can watch movies on mobile with this speaker and mobile stand 
ok
quality of performance not adequate
the voice of any audio was cracking looks like got bad piece not satisfied with it 
the sound is very poor have more jbl speaker whose sound quality is excellent this is similar to see but the sound quality is very poor
distortion of sound was seen post using for weeks not sure what to do tried resetting the device as well
bakwaaa hai jbl ke naam pe mat lena kabhi bhi na aawaaz na base ek dum ghatiya hai 
ok
very small in size as it can be kept in your pocket sound quality is excellent but volume and bass is not up to the value as compared to the products in this same price returned
this is chota packet bada dhamka you will really gonna enjoy sound of this device battery life is ok sound quality is good
soundbot sb is much better than this awesome loudness nd battery life for soundbot don wasteoney on jbl
bluetooth connecting is ok but the bass and the sound quality is not good as heard from many jbl speakers like this it has very less bass and less sound quality
bluetooth connectivity is very easily sound quality is best
it definitely not match display product is very tiny is no better than any smart phone loud speaker mode dissapointing amazon shud definitely work on avoiding deceptive deals instead appreciate genuine sellers with apt promotions
in starting awesome but after some days awaz phatni shuru
this product is just awesome superb is very good charges very quickly stays for very long time 
this is such ridiculous service for best products in market was facing some trouble with myjbl t earphones right earpiece was not working have sent the product to indian service centre laptron service centre located in nehru place new delhi first the mobile number given on the page and provides by jbl agent don work at all landline works but its get busy all the time they told me it takes days to replace the product that was fine with me waited but after days called many times and agent told me we will check it and will give you call or send you message but never received any call or message they never informed whats the status of the replacement will send email to higher authority as well because can tolerate this kind of service for such awesome product even your jbl toll free never received my call and your support contact form is also not working don know why you guys do not care about the indian customer higher authorities must be aware about this what yu guys are doing in india and what kind of support you are providing 
it fine
not good performance
soulful bt not louder 
pros sound is really very nice fills the room completely but do not expect much its really very compact even small rhan muy mobile phone signal strength it really goo upto feet works absolutely fine cons it dosent have any fm connectivity as it isnt mentioned as well but in this price range we easily get those options of external support as well but in this miniature we didn get those benifits means you need to have your mobile phone to operate this which is somehow disappointing for me no otg no tft card support no usb this is not worth buy for me you can easily go for muve acoustics portronics posh which have better qualifications and even waterproof as well 
worth money
very compact but the sound quality isn satisfactory ended up returning it 
ok not great sound but decent enough
good product
wow what deal in great indian sale it for and after that it is feeling lutya gaya amazon te
good product but volume level is limited it fine for use in room 
what beast m blown away it perfect flawless worth every penny edit after months of use the loudness is gone for some reason and there slight distortion too the clarity still decent but the quality is nowhere close to when bought it oh and jbl doesn give warranty for products bought online which makes no sense not worth the investment 
not much clarity in the sound although it serve the purpose 
अच छ स प कर ह आव ज भ अच छ ह ब ल ट थ क र ज भ अच छ ह ल क न ब स म इतन अच छ नह sound clarity bass 
this product does not have the quality was expecting eventually had to return the device it was not fulfilling the need 
sound quality very good
life without music wud a mistake yes am an audiophile as like only portable things so it was much needed also its really difficult to keep heavy speakers if r frequently relocated after reading all the reviews was expecting it wud awesome but never expected it wud blast really jbl is jbl although had jbl speakers before so its quality is pretty known to me but this time it is beyond imagination don need any heavy speaker if its wid me more than sufficient sound clearity very decent bass very loud am really surprised update although liked it very much but it is not working first two days it worked well but now red light is continuously on power button is not working highly disappointed wl buy creative a returning this product bought philips f with lotz of search asking with my friends it awesome with lotz of features now relaxed 
facing problem with bluetooth connectivity all the time this is second one first bought black one that was awesome but this one has connectivity issue
size is compact so is the sound it is for only small room not for party other stuff it should be more powerful
got it for and used it for month so writing brief review of it speakers are good and the look is just too good with rubber feel main reason to buy jbl was durability rough use purpose brand for traveling the orange colour helps you to recognize it instantly in the bag pros nice sound rubber finish compact affordable durable mic to talk from distance hook space to hang with bag cons sound is fantastic in small room but in large room it just okayish not party type speaker average battery life buy it only if you want to listen some quality music not to party with people if your pure purpose is music just quality music nothing else then buy one of logitech or xiaomi both are fantastic 
good portable speaker one can carry it in his her pocket sound quality is good but not so good as expected 
good product
speaker goes off automatically at lower volumes frequent audio lags in between songs bass is not that good 
bass and sound quality is ok but not upto the mark or expected 
the product is good for it price but the sound quality did not liked 
sound base is not gud
performance not good what expected
not as expected sometimes its sound changes to different have to press the phone call receiver button to adjust the sound accordingly hate the product 
absolutely no bass and no independent volume control when the volume of the device is increased the phone volume increases philips is far better high price paid returning to amazon thanks amazon for the flexibility
battery back up is really poor sound is ok
good to go one of the best product available for this budget 
not worth
ordered grey got orange rest all is ok 
the best one and awsome
it is good but not upto the expectation 
good but sound quality and bass not so great 
other than sound quality everything else is awesome
super
average quality product sound quality ok not amazing amazon packing was poor amazon packing box was seal open 
small and sleek the product work efficiently 
bluetooth stops working not dependable although sound is good gave to use with aux
sound is awesome but life is less compared to what is written its battery lasts only for hrs while it was written to be lasting for hrs 
only material quality is best
sound quality is not as much as expected for price paid product is cute to carry anywhere and user friendly 
ok ok
this is my third piece of jbl go in last years bt don think this product is good as my previous buys the sound is too low nt happy with it nt worth the price this time
average performance no indication of inside battery and always switched on to adapterwhile palying
as per expectation good
hello am getting really low sound from my jbl go portable speaker as well as its logo paint is coming off am starting to doubt its ingenuity now have another piece red colored of the same model which had purchased from flipkart year ago and it works well and is loud and clear my jbl speaker grey is still in warranty please help me with this issue please send me genuine product in same color grey 
it good wireless bluetooth speakers 
good but not the best logitech x that bought previously for around is much better reasons being can connect to only device logitech can connect to two simultaneously quite useful for people who connect both phone and laptop at the same time will turn off automatically even when the bluetooth device is connected unlike logitech which will turn off only when bluetooth device disconnects or turns off sound quality is ok but nothing special to write about in fact felt the some types of bass audio tends to annoy me when play through this 
i received the parcel which was torn have no clue if this is the original product 
quality was good sound was awesome but woofer is nothing but d gives this product same prise and unbelievable woofer sound
ok
sound quality is pour
hello the jbl speaker shown is really exaggerated and is very small unlike looking in the picture the image is decisive 
establishing new bluetooth connection is very difficult job not good product
it is too small for the prize it has good bass but it sound not that loud 
product is awesome but was not sealed 
this speaker sucks have used jbl flip and soundsticks by harman so know about sound this portable speaker is useless and not loud and not clear it is much better to go for fenda swan as it deliver richer low end and better mids also the sound signature is wide and surrounding also it has micro sd and much better sound stage choice is yours 
there is no that much volume effect it is not worthy for that amount 
logitech x is far better than jbl go in all aspects like cost quality battery bass etc the only additional feature in jbl go is call answer mode which dont feel very imp and if this feature doesnt matter then surely go logitec x at much reasonable cost 
medium sound
nice but not loud enough to cover entire house okey to cover living hall and sound quality is also okey type and not so fine 
good sound but it just stopped working after two months and cudnt reach the seller bucks down the drain no warranty so all the best to those who buy this
very over rated speaker very low sound quality compared to other ordinary speaker but speaker is very compact 
product quality is just ok but some sounds are not good from this product overall am not satisfying fully with this product
sound is not loud enough as compared to other bràds buy it if rclooking for device which will amplify the sound good enough for people p
no bass though it good
sound is clear connectivity is good look wise is good carey to easy with this shape 
sound quality is ok not that great it does not working in samsung android devices even not detected by win computer works well in iphone
nice product bought it in deal
ok
good product at affordable price music is clear but bass is not that great 
sounds isn loud and it didn sync properly with my laptop bluetooth 
in budget best offer
it stopped working and not getting recharged where is support centre
the audio performance is quiet good however the selection buttons on top are not visible particularity during dark hours contrast color would have been better 
good speaker for the price it is loud enough for small bed room sound reproduction is fair bass is little on the lower side and also the high frequency is not reproduced properly you cannot compare it with any big speakers or bluetooth speakers in range hands free calling works fine no issues there go for it if you need ultra portable average performance speaker with value for money 
super produced
sound is good but not sound clarity please improve sound clarity
packing is good but did not work at all it was gift to someone but was embarrassed so please return or give me new and test products when got this product red light is always on and no button was working picture att
quality of sound is nice but not enough loud its better to use normal phone speakers than spending k
an average product don know why there so much hype about jbl didnot feel the sound extraordinary and overpriced too 
not as good as expected from jbl speaker automatically changes mode to slow or high volume not satisfied with it 
not good not good not good not good not good not good not good not good not good not good
with the kind of price we have it doesn come to my expectations it fill only tiny room for entertainment and most important doesn reflect beats out of it for me it is just ok not grand piece from jbl thanks
a little bit extra money for this sound quality while comparing with other same product but brand is brand nice connection even m no disturbance
wastage of money hang ho gaya kal hi liya tha 
ok
the battery performance isn good it can barely last for hours on full volume not satisfied with battery life 
bass quality is not there but durability is there sound quality needs to be improved as local speakers have bass option
nice product
sound is not upto the mark bass is superb though 
outstanding sound clearity 
super
the top volume could have been louder sometimes it doesn feel sufficient when m playing it in front of room full of people the build quality looks good have purchased the cute bright pink one looks beautiful 
ok
material quality is very good but the sound quality is very poor speaker diaphragm vibration sound coming from the speaker in the idling time there is humming sound coming from the speaker
it is not loud enough the highest volume is almost as high as my phone speaker would rather spend little extra and buy better speaker with high volume 
size is small sound quality ok
don expect bass or good sound clarity it just loud speaker like you hear in s teashops just size of tea cup
the speaker is good but not the best now gave it stars because bought it months ago it worked very fine but after hard use of it now the sound quality has reduced don why but really appreciate the battery life and the call quality 
proper wastage tatti sound
good product 
nice product fast delvred all good but aux doesnt work but accept coz sound battery backup are well otherwise not bad
ok
bought it in january been using it for months initially it used to take hours to charge and used to play music for hours str now it charges in mins the red charging light goes off and discharges in mins can really use it without keeping it on charging always moreover if on charging power goes off the device switches on automatically and battery drains out besides the sound quality the portability has lost its meaning as of now moreover the sound buttons are simple useless if you are playing it using aux cable and increase the volume on speaker to max it switches off in seconds this has been happening since the starting had high hopes with the product unfortunately feel should have bought wired speakers only after putting so much money in this thing 
ok ok quality not for high volume and bass lovers
voloume is slow was expect big but it is normal product is good
never think of buying this it stopped working exactly within months of purchase it just play some sec and stops if you turn off and turn it on again it works for another sec and stops unfortunately the return window is closed as well now we end up at the mercy of the company to send replacement product aweful product sound quality is below par as well it is not even near to what loud is never get deceived by the looks 
do not buy this go for zoook rocker encore the real beast amazon link http amzn to nevwd jbl ke naam bade aur darshan chhote but zoook is the second name of mi 
good product
super

the volume and bass is not very high as expected it a fine purchase not satisfactory one

good sound clarity pairing is easy only problem is it gives echo to people on the other end of the line when on phone call other than that great product am using it in our office for conference calls works nicely until the echo comes echo does not come always it comes once in calls 
loudness is ok but sound quality is not good
it sounds awesome with fantastic noise level but totally disappointed with the colour in order pictures its shown as occur green but in real its different its fade green actually 
i bought jbl go bluetooth speaker by one and half month before but now jbl is not working properly can find jbl in my phone bluetooth is not working what can do please help me out my email address is ashokbiradar gmail com
it a good speaker however at full volume sound tears up and that can easily be noticed in its range it is better than any other bluetooth speaker 
not happy with the sound advise to purchase something more expensive but with better sound quality 
the speaker makes strange ssss sound while playing certain songs however like it being compact
the speaker is awesome sound quality not upto the mark as compared to sony portable speaker but good for the price 
zzzzz type of sound comes 
less peak volume ok for silent surroundings
ok ok not so good
sound quality is good battery backup is not that great its very tiny and has good build quality light weight and its got rubbery surface overall its good product 
ok ok 
i wanted to connect it to my acer laptop but the bluetooth of two devices is not compatible it works well with the android phone and has good voice quality solved the problem by using mm aux cable it needs to be wi fi enabled to be most useful 
product is no doubt awesome but the dimension not match with website and with the product physically size of the website shown the dimension 
good product not that loud as expected 
i hav recently bought this product and now speaker can connect mobile
good clean design mid range and treble sounds are pretty tight affordable design performance value for money overall 
sound quality is not good it didnot even last for one year
hi team this product is stopped working from last weeks request you to please send copy of invoice of this product so that can visit nearest service center to repair it thanks avinash
as mentioned in specification it works for hours of playtime under optimum audio settings but playtime is only up to hrs which is unexpectable 
sound quality is good as well as range but price is too high for this
good product
it the smallest portable branded speaker have ever used and the build quality is excellent and sound quality is not as expected bass is little bit more and less balanced it should have been diminished by fraction otherwise liked this so much bought it on diwali sale so received good discount so thanks amazon for the discount and for this price range it is average and liked the portability it feels good by holding it it can easily rest in pants pockets 
disappointing sound quality mobile phones play music with more clarity 
yes it is good happy at your service thanks 
sound is ok type loudness and bass is not at all ok for one small room only
good packing but sound also good but receiving problem checking several phones near by phone it was strucking 
superb but the price too high
ok
overall its good product loud enough to fill room nice sound quality but personally think that jbl clip sounds better bluetooth works fine even with linux has good battery life 
the product which received is not in running condition don buy 
this product is really over hyped it is very mediocre bass almost missing along with does not have much clarity on high frequency over all sound is around very mid frequency which may be good for some bollywood music but over all not all pleasing sound for ears 
good sound quality as the brand says it all about it handy with good finishing only the cone is battery back up is not up to the mark it last around hours rather not hours which is guranteed by the company 
i bought for some one and he is happy with this product 
didn liked the jbl speaker at all have local bt speaker which works better than jbl branded bt speaker even the sound clarity and beats are similar to the local one which cost me just didn liked the product it is not worthful 
ok
i bought jbl go bluetooth speaker from amazon in the great indian sale it was really good ofc with it performance but it wasn charging like damn went ssly nuts wen found that but thanks to amazon return policy have returned it and ordered for new one hoping this one will be good one fingers crossed 
received an duplicate product
good product
sound bad other products are very good quality of sound
bought it seeing all the nice reviews but the product disappointed totally its just gives load sound but spoils the music completely no bass no lower notes may be am expecting too much from product but jbl with go has disappointed me totally if this would have been around then there wouldn have been so much of disappointment atleast 
good and nice for small room and night music
pros portable great bass experience cons cheap plastic finish cannot expect more for this price overall nice product
it feels good but don expect more overall superb gadget 
gud not best
ok
the product is good and built is nice as well had quick delivery sound is amazing for this small device which is worth for this price started using from today and hope it should perform the same 
nice balanced sound however battery did not last even an hour so returned the product
it nice but price is too much high
i feel the product is dublicate 
it was actually gifted to me by friend it sounded awesome bass was decent battery also decent but dont know if it happened to only my device after week or so of use noticed noise which wasnt there before even when dont play anything can hear the noise its sounds an electrical interferance or some sort maybe that wont happened to other device maybe was just unlucky but did love it 
good nice and useful while travalling
good but not excellent
ok
utterly disappointed with the prodcut actually had jbl at home which are excellent quality hence thought to order this to gift my mother however when received was surprised to see that the quality is not good the speaker has some subtle but piercing noise continuously am not happy with the quality at all
ok not great 
sound quality is really good but the bluetooth gets disconnected sometimes it irritating it fulfilled by amazon but got product that was previously returned by some customer there a lot of dust on it when opened it
difficult to connect bass is average battery is superb bluetooth is also average
it a good product you can go for it 
thieves ordered it fr my mum in cal she got the package she opened it up all excited to put her devotional mantras eat not and it actually ridiculously hilarious she got brick bubbled wrapped to perfection got the refund though but now she goes to the local electronics store to buy gadgets can say why maybe she didn like the packing hmmm 
this attractive wallet sized speaker is easy to take along on trips and connects with most bluetooth devices but apart from that they won produce lot of sound and all of your rock songs will sound terrible on this 
sound quality of this product is just ok the sound is not clear and smooth but its like bass only build material is good handy too but overall sound quality disappointing
sound quality is awesome but costs little higher
received the product yesterday performance wise it is very satisfying but noticed the red indicator of charging goes off after some time maximum miniutes is it fault or regular feature if somebody can guide me or have to return 
nice
bluetooth is not so accurate sound quality need to be improved
the product is good and sound is very clear but if you are looking for something loud then you should be looking for other speakers 
it good
small nice
returned and bought portronics soundpot which has much better bass and listening experience 
ok
the product is simple sound quality is not so super compare as name so m only little bit satisfied
wrost sound output
i got defective speaker bluetooth connectivity problem interupting bluetooth in very short distance whereas other brand philips connectivity is stronger please check this issue sound bass all fantastic than other brands but this the main problem today only got the delivery faced this problem
not perfect sound
review after two days use got this jbl go just in hrs after ordering fast delivery by amazon hats off portrayed like imitation of bigger box speakers look nice pros sound clarity is average not the very best feel jam classic is pretty good than this battery backup is great working more than hours what they mentioned auto switch off feature works well it saves batter usage lot my previous jam classic doesn have this feature drains faster cons no play forward backward buttons which have in jam classic feel this is major con volume button is not syncing with the mobile it works separately bass is average jam classic rocks here am not able to hear the music clearly while the song is having even little bass not good for voice calling noise echo cancellation doesn work well getting echo to the other end voice clarity out put is very bad not able to understand the remote voice clearly feel this product is not good going to return 
ok
edit august it stopped working all of sudden if you get this under inr then it a pretty nice deal the volume levels are surprisingly high and is more than enough for small room or car the bass is adequate for speaker of this size you can easily hold of them in one hand at the same time even if you don have extra large hands it is small enough to fit in your pocket and yet has very good battery life 
i purchased it from amazon its not so gud sound is good but baas and sound quality is not gud it like normal speaker with high volume 
good sound quality and liye weaited good pocking
the jbl speaker which have ordered does not have clarity in the sound there is disturbance coming in whenever play song or video have requested for an exchange with new piece of the product hoping to get good one this time 
sound quality is ok
nice product 
it worked well for month now it shows very bad quality audio with more vibration
there is crackle sound on the music
decent sound can listen upto hrs in full charged battery battery takes around mins to fully charged if you can spend bugs should go for flip ii this produce great sound or if don have size issue should consider portronics sublime or another products from portronics 
good product 
it worked perfectly ok for almost months then all of sudden it stopped charging usb charging stopped working now its piece of scrap its warrantee card says that its valid only for australia need clarification from amazon in why it was sold in india 
it a good product however since it has only one driver do miss the stereo effect it does the job pretty well but feel should have opted for one with sound drivers 
it definitely not that great there are many other options out there go for better one for sure 
nice
the sound is just ok bought portronics pot and jbl go and compared both of them portronics is better in terms of ease of use user friendly and sound 
it okay okay at this price if you need that bass effect then it is not for you go for somewhere in the range between k thankfully the seller processed the refund am still searching for good speaker with good bass effect 
awesome product but m disappointed because got the product on rupees nd next day it available on rupees
volume is not so dazzling size is good
cost is high for its performance average 
product is very good but deliverywas awful got delivered in different building 
ok
good product nice sound handy
it is very small and don produce much loud sound
ok
too small product rest is good sound clarity but not that much sound what we axpet and price is also very high 
not worth buying 
product is ok 
i bought this product came abroad with out checking the same now when am charging it don get charged disappointed with the product 
nice
the product is good but not expected volume high in sound 
it a mediocre speaker definitely not for an audiophile above average bass below average treble not too loud but loud enough to play inside the home or car sound quality doesn deteriorate much at higher volumes which is plus point build quality is also good
cute tiny in size but big in sound and good k jbl go can not match the performance of lg ph so if you want to buy go with lgph that price drops to k oftenly
sound quality of protronix sound pot is far better than this
quality of sound is brilliant but it is excessive low and for speaker in this price range can get far more better
okay okay product sound could have been better
just today received it looks fairly well yet to check days 
darshan chota lakin kaj bada
good one put charging finish very fast only stay till hr rest voice is nice 
ok product 
sound is cracking had ordered one from flipkart it been years and still running fine you have delivered the product twice with inferior sound quality
it sound quality is good but its bluetooth is not working it not play the song my phone android my phone is unicorn yu so is there any other settings pl guide me 
excellent sound quality but it has the worst battery it gives only minutes backup after one year of usage
i bought it because wanted to go for jbl there are better one available at less price but if you need jbl then it won disappoint sound is good 
bought this on th december worked wonderfully till today little over year the sound is just become of what it used to be both volume and quality 
got this speaker from infinitycompu but aftr days it suddenly gets off no sound coming from the speaker very disappointed from amazon plz help me to replace this item the sound is good but now its just connect but no sound is coming from the speaker 
ok
overall good
as per sound quality this product is good but within six months one side of my headphone is not working 
the loudness of the speaker is very low even my mi a mobile is louder wanted to replace the item as soon as first checked it but there was no return option for the product except for its low loudness the speaker is light weight and has performed well 
sound is good but bluetooth range is not too good 
its good
it lookes premium quality but sound very bad and roufgh at in price range boat beats it and it has no bass radiator but it bluetooth coverage is very good and best for portable it would ne best if price was about rupees 
ok ok
i bought bluetooth speakers by trusting the brand bt it worked month only now its not working want to replace my product
awesome sound but now it useless after just months the speaker is not working 
crap total crap
 sound volume is very low forget about bass it sucks do not buy this go for d and other brands jbl go is complete disaster 
very nice product
nice
pocket monster small yet convincingly loud enough overall okayish product bought it for it is budget friendly as compared to other humungous bluetooth speakers which of course have additional features 
product is good sound quality is also good but there is big problem in this item and that is country of origin which is china and thats why am returning this product 
ok
i bought for good sound but quality is medium 
as it is from jbl blindly purchased it but was dissapointed with the bass sound where its not at all good cause earlier from amazon have purchased photron for although it was spoiled after one year but the quality is completely satisfactory also it has best bass but the jbl bass is not at all good even comparing with photron anyhow have placed it for return but design wise and the bluetooth connectivity and the range fom phone to this is just amazing thanks 
sound quality is good for medium sized room it is good 
the speaker is very compact and good audio quality is ok for its size its not great the mic sensitivity is not satisfactory it doesn have aux out so if you want to connect headphones for any reason to the device it doesn work suprisingly aux connection volume is much less than blue tooth connected volume the call button works perfectly if you really dont need it for call you can go for cheaper options k is bit high for the quality 
product is good but the sound is not enough not worth of rs 
sound is good compared with other variants in same price category poor battery quality
super 
pretty good sound for small instrument but for durability will give zero to my utter shock it stopped working after weeks 
sound quality bass effect not up to level sorry jbl bad experience
it sounds good
ordered this product after viewing the photo and reviews of people but after receiving did not find as per expectation sound starts vibrating when volume is increased 
sound quality wise feel its ok however the sound is enough loud the small in size is the best thing about it the connectivity is also upto the mark 
a honest review there may be better performance in other segment as battery life sucks
this product is good for music lovers best quality and sound is sweet 
after watching few unboxing videos of the product on youtube suspect that the one delivered to me might not be authentic how to find out for sure suggestions welcome 
not much sound and bass average performance
maine jbl go bluetooth speaker feb ko order kia tha feb ko deliver hua march se bluetooth speaker phone sath connect nhi hua one year warranty me kese replace kru pls suggest kyunki return window feb ko close ho chuki h
hearing good reviews about this model ordered and got faulty piece no sound at all is coming from the speaker
good quality product 
not worth for the money
this is very small in size but sound is good
stoped working 
i am not satisfied with the product price and quality according to price of product is not contain wonderful quality 
awesome speaker with beautiful bass thank you jbl and amazon for these products but giving only hours backup
at given price quality is understandable purchased for portability using jbl micro with external bluetooth adapter you can play nice quality fm on micro from mobile using headphones and keep mobile near door for better reception
good connectivity sound output is average at the lrice range much better options are available
product didn had that was so much surprised to see that it was not there its good product but not completely satisfied when connected with bluetooth sound breaks in between again and again so had to return this product 
purchased the product on th jan wireless range of this product is pathetic strongly recommend to not to buy this product because of its condition after and half year of usage right now the battery backup is minutes can even imagine why they call it portable yes you read it right the speaker is working only when its connected to power source now when contact customer support they say the warranty lapsed you need to pay to get the product repaired who on this planet spends on travelling to the service centre and pay for the repair which costs almost same as the product cost trust me guys it ain worth what you are paying for 
the product is very good and the sound quality is amazing 
the sound is good bought the product in october when it came full charge would last days and now full charge does not last beyond hours the sound is good but the battery is awful look for miller product with better battery
good sound quality clearity 
sound quality is good need much developement in this product 
quality is good but it is good if you re using it in very small area you can at all hear the sound keeping the device in room and listening in your hall too small sometimes bluetooth connectivity issue comes but that is compromisable due to not of being on repetitive basis sound quality is good but recommenede for small living area
was expecting usb charger along usb cable but the product didnt had that was so much surprised to see that it was not there its gud product but not completely satisfied that was it like this
sound is good for the size of the speaker charging is quick battery life not as advertised overall an ok buy for the sale price of inr 
too compact slight disturbance in the audio
ok ok product
it a great spekar very sweet sound quality looks nice but if you like bass then select others option 
definitely it was used product which got repackaged and it does not work and more importantly its not black in colour scratch marks are clear in its charging port just received the product few minuted early another product of sandisk is working though
ok ok product
speaker is nice but it is dublicate one
i got the product in completely tampered condition packing was open and it was almost sure that it was used product as far as product is concerned it is good for normal use as it is just watt 
sound not much loud no bass
not happy with it
it is not working like jbl this sound we will get from local bluetooth speeker worth rs its aux out not working 
ok
ok ok item
it ok
the sound quality is good but bluetooth connectivity stopped working 
ok
it a good speaker but it produce muddy sound not clear sound as like to listen this speaker is for watching movies not listening music if you want to purchase for watching movies then go for it but it is not made for music 
looking not impressed
just bought sound quality ok not great very small in size 
good product looks nice and sound is also good and loud enough 
good product with compact size 
excellent product but it available for rs cheaper just day after purchased it this is not fair amazon please look into it 
it not password protected sound quality is ok
the sound is excellent but while connecting from laptop there some problem plays fine from mobile device but from laptop the sound is broken and disrupted guess need to get the device replaced as this is the second one have ordered he first one did not have any such issues 
this product is good and use to full sound his performance are hours 
worth buying nice to carry very easy to use 
sound quality good but not great good product at this price recommend jbl flip instead exchanged it later 
it is decent product
sound could be better build quality is excellent
good vocal
price bht zada hai bhai logg speaker accha hai waise
isme battery alag se lena hoga kya 
nice product but not upto the expectation was expecting little bigger speaker with reasonable bass but this one is very small in size but loudness and clarity of sound is very good but don expect any good bass in this
good quality
pretty fast delivery beautiful miniature by jbl my real colour looks amazing but feel the product delivered to me by amazon is not genuine and its first copy bass quality is poor and you can hear kind of disturbance and sound cracks this is definitely not how jbl performs 
the speakers were good but the sound wasn loud enough my laptop speakers give about the same performance so ended up returning the product but all in all nice speakers especially for the size 
this is low quality product the sound quality is very bad if you play any high beat music or say play punjabi music which has generally loud beats sound comes like torn drum speaker size that is shown in image is very large while the actual system is very small smaller then the size of your palm amazon is cheating people by showing wrong sized image this is surprise you get when you open the packet if you haven seen one had purchased this basis others reviews on amazon which are crap although tested other products from stone protonics philips which are actually better then this could not test this anywhere and here will have to live with this crap wrote to amazon but the best they did was replace one peace with another of same brand 
the bass is no good overall the sound quality was not up to the expectation as compared to other products of the same range
acceptable
good product
excellent service by amazon this is good product worth its price would recommend for its intended use 
nice
jbl portable speaker loss it bluetooth connectivity it is not working so am sending it back to seller please keep it or replace it courtesy jagdishsaini gmail com renowned customer amazon india 
not worth
sound breaking issue sometimes rest sound quality is good and loud 
this is decent speaker but not worth for inr despite got it in deal this is not worth for the money mainly for the below reason not great sound low volume low bass no wire for hanging the speaker not great sound clarity suggest people to buy boat speaker which is an awesome experience for inr 
not connecting bought it month ago and bluetooth suddenly stops working it not showing to any device for further pairing rate it star coz it sound quality is awesome in prize range and now am facing this problem pls help 
nice product
good product 
super product
battery backup nd sound problame nd high rate
good sound
very nice
the speaker works flawlessly however wish the bass and clarity was much more may be should have increased my budget bit the size of the speaker is very small 
very bad bass and sound superb not good at all
small in size and cute in shape speaker having medium sound and bass only good for single use not good for party and all
comparing to sound pot portronics this product is ok sound clarity is clear but not much loud 
sound is ok but nit showing light of bluetooth on or device connected
its ok ok
after reading reviews thought of getting something good in this price range where am seeing other good options at k but unfortunately as product price speak it is just not worth it not pleasant to ears and very small like combination of two small match box it is good if you want to watch movie or listen real soft music it is not made up for real music initiated refund after listening half an hour at different places and most genre of music thank you 
sound is not high but the sound clarity is good enough
easy to carry as it is very small clear sound but bass is poor slightly overrated other brands are also available with the same price but with better specifications consumers should compare properly and then decide 
i like the crystal clear voice of that speaker if the sound volume is little bit higher then it will must be good super product that must be top in market the material quantity is very good but you have to improve sound quality because it is not so higher sound but the battery life is so good and really impressed about this product thank you jbl 
nice product
after reading the reviews and suggestions posted this jbl go portable looked attractive to me and bought it but it has serious blue tooth connection related issues the song starts breaking in between both in case of wifi buffering and when you run saved songs from your mobile handset finally have returned the product thanks to amazing service of amazon am looking for better bluetooth speaker now 
hey all got this speaker today only and also filed replacement requested after few hours as the speaker was not getting charged and wasn showing red light while charging but reordered this only as this is one of the best speaker in k range sound quality is awesome clarity of music is there bass quality is also good appropriate for indoor as well as outdoor usage as volume is quite appreciable exept the charging problem everything was good but no one can beat this in its range amazon service is really fast got pickup today itself and hoping for the same service in future too 
pros small and compact fast and systematic bluetooth connectivity good sound cons no fm not for bass lovers its not that loud in that budget expect little more features as competitors provide better options in same budget although it is good but if can spend or extra buy portronics sublime speakers suggest portronics sublime h are much better budget wise and overall sound bass is also good enough although bluetooth connectivity problem occurs very often but once connected its awesome even while changing rooms it will not loose the connectivity plus it has lots of modes fm aux bluetooth usb pc etc its around and love it 
sound was verry clear but not acceptable bass and throwing capacity
lmao don buy this sh get the mi bluetooth speaker basic have used both and the mi one is absofuckinglutely amazing 
this speaker is not worth money sound scatters after one hour if played continuously
the bass is too high and so not the best on voice speech clarity songs sound fine though battery has been pretty good over years 
only loudness no picking of mid tones not worth it for this price if want quality sound or choose best speaker then dont go for it its loudness monster only it will fill your x room with sound 
gud product looks gud built quality gud but battery life not up to the mark as expected
sound is fab and the size also very small
not worth the price really in grands you have lot more varieties with lot better sound output in market 
jbl go is very good product from harman bought it on world music day it sound is good as it size sub bass is absent but it is okay for its size overall it very good portable speaker for its prize range 
product is really awesome amazing sound and connectivity but stopped working exactly after two months 
sound quality is good 
the sound quality is good but does not cater to my needs 
size sound
after use of months sometimes it creates problem in connection blur sound sometimes it plays in loud and another moment in low not good for ruff tuff use 
songs cheng in spekar opshon plz attach keka
good product
very comapact and handy but audio quality is average bass is average and sound start distorting at high volume 
material quality is good but sound is not good
good speaker very useful 
poor battery life the rest overall ok 
today got it but think mic is not working plz give solutions 
nice but could have been better 
good one but battery is not good
the package was open and the charging cable was missing it seemed like used item am disappointed as it was birthday gift
the sound from speakers sounds very different the bass is off and most of the songs get ruined due to this although my friend has the same product and her works fine guess there was some problem with my product but nonetheless not worth buying
sir ordered for pink speaker but got the grey color overall performance is good
the highest volume is not what expected very small and portable easy to carry clarity is very normal not impressive
received the product but there was no seal over the box seems that the this is return product of someone else and the speaker get discharged within one hour but no doubt sound is good 
just ok
bit less than ok sound looks durable treble lil low but clear sound easily connectable would have been better offer 
love it
positive side of jbl sound is cool small cute with amazing base and it jbl man obviously sound is perfect can use for hours even if you don charge it regularly negative side of jbl did not even last for month stuck with red colour light and not working it your luck if it works for more than month another wise you something money is totally wasted unhappy with amazon and its product now amazon service please look towards this matter or am never going to buy any stuff from amazon things ve buyed from amazon never last longs aneesha
ok
the sound quality is good but not that loud its ok but not to that mark overall good daily usage not party type 
the product was nice when bought it got good sound quality but it automatically stopped working after months and now there is no option for return so felt like my money got wasted this is my first review about product and hope it will be useful to someone 
this is cute but am not getting the expected volume
the product was gud delivery was on time sound quality is superb for close room experience overall gud product at this price
ok for buying but volume is not up to the mark
sound quality is ok but as expected
nice product sound big very happy
charge won last maximum hour and sound clarity is not as expected not worth for money 
very good product overall its quality is very good voice is clear but slight slow easy to handle and carry its durable like it value for money 
received danaged product
give original product with its normal price dont cheat people by giving offers
nice product don expect high volume
sound quality not good enough for music but for vocal songs without music the sound quality is awesome great portability price is too high the price should be under k 
even after such good reviews about the product ve faced ssues with the product with connectivity the sound was getting cracked and the songs were fastforwarding on its own opted for an exchange the first time now it happened for the second time and m taking refund this thing has been going on for month now not happy about this product which ve received but apart from that sound clarity is good for its size very compact and handy 
nothing really great good enough for smaller spaces good battery back up
this quality is very good
battery backup not good product good
don expect big sound and bass it is ok instead can go for d is more better then this in price range and sound
elegant in looks good sound quality lesser features than other products thus not value for money 
product is expensive but sound is not satisfactory as price dont buy this product
item didn worked had to return it to amazon and received refund after month 
can get better at this price range other than price issues good product overall compact quality sound long battery backup 
sound plays zig zag returned the piece 
nice bluetooth speakers
not worth it
i bought this after reading many amazon reviews which stated this as the best pick in this segment while can partially agree with that still feel that it is definitely overrated the sound quality was very very average which is very similar to that from an d speaker which costs lot cheaper the audio is clear but hardly there is any bass there is no passive radiator for bass the festive deal price was around rs but still feel it as overpriced may be just for the brand jbl if you are seriously looking for good quality sound output with some decent bass then this speaker is not the one to consider 
sound very low bass was gud material quality was gud
speaker is good but sound quality is not good
not good value for money sound is not very pleasant 
good sound
i had paid for gift pack but got normal parcel 
the speaker is good the charging cable point stopped working within month but as it was under replacement warranty got the new speaker the sound is sufficient for small room you cannot expect loud sound from it but the sound is good even at its maximum point 
i did get the product very fast it was unexpected thnks to amazon but expected an extra cable with the product through which can use when dont have bluetooth like in led over all jbl speakers are always best 
it nice however all the songs stop spontaneously initially again have to restart this is happening repeatedly 
looking is good but sound quality is low bass is ok an
it ok 
sound quality and bass is good but think amazon delivered second hand product because after few days of using many problems occurs eg charging indication light etc so returned this speaker 
six months in am very unhappy with it performance it keeps disconnecting so many times 
feels awesome only in intial days days it started giving trouble of bluetooth connectivity it not working so returned it back waiting for refund only since days 
product stopped working in months time it has no warranty also from either amazon or jbl buy any jbl product like lottery chances of it working is far less than its not working basically money down the drain keeping it as paper weight thanks jbl for giving an inferior product under your brand name speaks volumes about your brand equity and thanks amazon for keeping such products under your umbrella 
i have not received mic only have received portable wireless bluetooth speaker blue working good but usb cable is in orange colour what have to do to get mic kavita
it won deliver the bass punch of your dreams if that your expectation if the audio has too much bass in it the blue led turns red can handle the base all that can be said about the speaker is that it better than phone speaker also the phone gets quite hot after prolonged bluetooth usage what liked about the bluetooth settings is that you can pair more than one device with it and next time it identifies the device and connects automatically 
sound is good but bit of sound crack after certain volume level also not very nice for melodious music overall good
very clearly the day got really expected may be lot but then jbl speaker and let me mention it clearly again an original jbl speaker should or may be would sound to be really crisp and clear now please for damn don say that for rs want more original bose or so to say bowers and wilkins or something of that cadre but man the clarity jbl speaker would and should always have it don go on my english here just try to understand that it seems not much real and that what am more concerned about local vendor next to my house even if known to may sell me d and for once that can be clear with the logics but on amazon which has all state of art testing and ratings should check to it may be wrong here but peeps very clearly feel its not real and somewhat close to it which is good but then giving us the feeling of real and playing it fake well that hurts yeah emotions are tough but then lets not get private and into friendzone side and be practical and ask the vendors that bhaiya original de do yar thode aur paise le ke kudos 
this product is not working with my samsung j prime but nice product good quality of voice and battery back up
i want to tell one thing everything is superb except charging charging is not up to mark 
na na
its okay not too bad it speakers arent too loud but looks great
can you believe got this product for free it a fine product but the biggest minus point for this tiny speaker is no dedicated slot for memory card play via bluetooth or you have no other options for playing an audio 
very ppor quality product one the buttons are too shallow to be easily accessible volume is pretty low when compared with philips bt the products sleeps off to save battery and needs to be reconnected everytime no autoconnect mechanism 
ok
i bit confuse while giving rating and writing comment ok wanna be fare enough about product so the product is good in quality as well as sound quality also but want to clear one thing if you have ever heard jbl charge series or jbl flip series then m sure that you won like this speakers sound output ok now don make any decision m saying this but there reason behind why you won like this jbl coz those are having w output with extra bass and acoustic that y those costs k and this is only one speaker but this is also very veg powerful to boom your whole house m music lover and heard jbl charge yrs back and still remember the quality and magic of that speaker but that was not mine now when decided to buy one so due to budget chose this one but to be honest is too high for this speaker it could have to be 
nice gadget have
let me list some pro and cons of this product pro will include light weight and small size but it feels like few buttons are missing like pause play button next previous button 
amazing product sound quality is superb only battery drains fast so have battery otherwise overall its an great product
average sound quality expected more as others gave good reviews not worth buying at this cost 
the sound quality is so sweet and soulful
loudness is just ok not so much as written in other reviews
nice product
nice sound quality even at full volume no humming sound at all fantastic but when connected with bluetooth sound breaks in between again and again still bluetooth volume is much better than aux 
its good speaker but sound is not really good for big room 
for rs the sound level that one gets out of it is not so great bluetooth connectivity is not great with mac atleast sound crackles at high volume total disappointment 
it good yeah am happy but one thing is battery backup is not hours am following all instructions but not favorable me 
after weeks use find it ok sound quality and portability is good 
music ok bluetooth connection ok taking calls from cell phone very poor mic and speaker are not separated clearly resulting in lot of echo in conversation basic feature missing here will not recommend for someone who is planning to use this to take calls for music it is ok but there are better jbl products in same price range with better sound quality if you are not looking at in buit mic
this product has been overrated sound is not very loud plus cant play bass not happy with the product 
sound quality little less impressive 
not worth spending bucks on this 
good product but best mi basic best product sound all hit product
good quality product great sound for its size and price but the original package seal was broken 
good quality
sond currently is so good but love to loud sond this product have limited sond volume think that chaina speaks have more sond in this size

built quality is good but sound is ok ok as old transistor so dislike it

sound quality is good but the st day when bought it got defect in battery after or min of start red light going on when charge it almost to min red light still going on press on off button but it didn twork after long try then its off faced this problem again and again so want to replace it after replaced got best it super
it has no fm if it has fm in built its bean good product sound quality base is impressive but not loud enough to reach watts product is very simple and not exited much about the brand it is not an innovative product as it is priced this much even it is not looking like decorative thing when we place on table or desk nothing special on it 
the battery got swerved up in less than month from purchase though the sound quality was awesome even now it works fine when connected to power however the battery conked out so soon 
nice one
not satisafied with the sound quality even bass is not that much as expexted rather its better to go for lg ph at lower price and better sound quality and loudness
wrong order delivered received kids talcum powder and hot water flask instead of speakers
nice
nice speaker for small room but bass lover not ll satisfied much more but cost is so high itne me to ek mini subwoofer aa jayega baki speaker accha par price kuch jyada hi hai overall dekha jaye to theek hai but cost high hai

the charging is not staying as per the description also getting stuck in between after sometime of playing the sound quality is awesome 
good sound 
not worth it

product is awesome but sound quality very low
nice bt need more bass
amazing product but connectivity issues on bluetooth which unfortunately is the only way to connect the device gets disconnected intermittently at times
great sound quality like it
ok
battery life is quite good for such small speaker but am disappointed with its sound quality it sound quality is average 
it gives low sound in outer as you go in open area the sound you hear will too soft this is only good for small size room can even make better sound in hall 
overall satisfied sound clear and loudness just ok for private listening buy only if needed to take speaker on travel otherwise nothing great 
sound quality is good but product stopped working 
this product starting very loud sound but now iss sound quality is week want o return this product

good sound
worst product ever bought local speaker have better sound quality 
ok ok
good quality 
i had heard of good reviews of the jbl go bluetooth speaker but less then month time it stopped working just yesterday and it has not been dropped or mishandled while in use in anyway take very good care of all my things and possession cannot figure out what wrong with the product probably got defective product have used it everyday and found it very good sound is good for what it is priced for but at higher volume you wont get good sound effect it starts cracking range is decent enough connecting after pairing with another devices is slightly poor light weight and very easy to carry around literally anywhere as long as your remain in the range while in use but for the sudden death of the product it is good little blue boy god bless 
good sound
the sound distorts while streaming videos on netflix prime videos on my laptop it works just fine when connected with mobile but the problem is there when connected to laptop 
accepted order cancelled for no reason 
it an smart product from jbl at this price but less sound output only fit for feet room my rating is between to stars 
nice product 
product is hong
timely delivered and great sound experience jbl awesome 
i got it for rs sound quality is not as my expectations but think best at this price 
i did not like the sound quality not worth it 
it ok but not great product the sound quality is not so good 
trust me do not buy this one instead go for soundbot sb in same price the sound is times more powerful and better in soundbot jbl go is not worth the price for sound quality and bass you get only benefit is they are smaller and lighter 
this is not worth sound is not good even 
satisfactory product
quality of sound is good but the volume of speaker is very low considering the price of speaker 
just ok 
please dont buy package was not good very low sound bass quality no bass no sound clearity at half volume over priced worth not 
ok sound
bluetooth audio disconnects after every minutes of playing
my earlier piece got battery problem so bought this good and iam enjoying it
different color orange color usb cable was sent instead of black color so odd look when we connect it sound quality ok but not superb 
fine good as if used first time 
 its jbl so no compromise within the limitation its handy can carry anywhere without any risk can hold in one hand good performance they managed to give best results within price limits built quality is good rubber like plastic coating protect it from shock if falls own bass is average but best in the range can use this for your room or car not perfect for outdoor who likes party value for money 
i accept it has good bass with jhankar but my acceptance is wrong only jhankar is there and not loud sound 
i don know got duplicate problem or what but after days of using it can say the sound is so not worth the money there are better sound speak speakers are available 
ok quality
sir this product jbl go portable wireless is not pairing with any device can it be replaced or what is the process for its repair kindly advice me thanking you yours faithfully c thapa

bass is ok sound quality is decent highly portable and built quality expected it to be slightly more loud good for watching movies and personal use totally underperforming when comes to dencing like sound out of 
battery life good for me it give hrs service non stop sounds are not good it ok anyone can buy it
the clarity of the speaker is very good but the bass is not good enough 
sound is good but when you using for calling option not good sound
battery life is not so good sound quality decrease with time but best in this range of price 
the red light on the speaker continuously glow even after removing the charger and the device fails to play 
the thing is that this is solid piece of entertainment for good price but the authenticity is questionable think its better for you to buy from jbl harmaan official site the scenario here is that if are lucky ll get good piece otherwise ll get sucker punched like me for the specs if want single channel sound system moderate bass good sound for this price and cool battery life
only stars not happy about the product poor packing its first time received the material with very bad packing
good sound
sound quality is good but loudness not upto the mark 
philips speaker was better than this in aspect have used both
i expected that it would be huge device but it was too small than expected sound charity is good base is good not all that loud but it a cheap budget speaker by jbl customers may like this product but for me it was okay though it harman it not all that loud kindly request amazon to show the picture of the speaker small but in other ways it the best speaker 
a decent speaker overrated though good for hostels 
sound quality is good but m not satisfied volume level
sound output is good based on size and price bluetooth working upto distance of feet also microphone working fine 
nice product
i brought this speaker to connect with mobile through bluetooth so that can listen songs clearly and it is serving the purposes appreciate the cost and features you can not compare home theater or dedication sound system sound quality but you ll get reasonable vocals and instruments clearity
vibration noise is predominant had bought the first one and replaced to find out if this problem with the first device but even the second one has his issue noise disturbance when the sound is bit high otherwise the performance is better 
for the price of its awesome sound clarity is super and bass is also good update bluetooth not working after single day of use its fully charged disappointed 
it okay the issue is in warranty card its all written in chinese is it really authentic 
build quality is good it looks premium buy had to return it due to sound not being enough for w speaker 
although the sound quality is very good keeping in mind the size of this bluetooth speaker yet right from the start it is having this issue of sound stuttering and dropouts have also reset it several times but to no avail 
it loses connection sometimes and isn as loud as would have liked it to be guess will just have to get bigger speaker for that 
sound quality is ok not so good
yes am very satisfied with jbl bt good value for money
gud
but received defective product none can beat it amazing sound excellent bass even it higher model is not as good as this one works great at full volume where it upper model doesn simply excellent it all about quality of sound got it at can get it for or cheaper in deal 
ok
sound quality is not good compare to prize and material quality and battery life are nice 
ok
amazon delivery is excellent but the product is as such avg in sound quality with avg bass think portronics sound pot in the same price range performs better however the build quality is excellent in jbl go also in long run think the jbl is more durable than others hence sound quality and build quality and durability 
found it in good condition adhering to the description on the site working well up till now satisfactory product
clear and loud sound hai paisa vasul hai
not much loud as expected its good but not satisfactory product quality is good but not bass and voice if want to lesson music at low volume than this product is made for 
good product already used other jbl product overall good
after advance payment items delivered within days actual product size is very small but as per image it show very good sound quality is ok not the worth of aprx k avoid to by from amazon 
sound is good but not loud price so high
sound quality is awesome but creaks in high frquency best choice for hostler 
ok average
great great great 
not so good just ok volume is not much high
first of all let me just say that absolutely love the look of this product it has lot of personality the battery life is decent it last me hours usually it has mic built in which might be handy for some people but don see much use for it myself my only complain is the sound quality of this product it seems there some sort of weird eqing going on that suppresses some frequencies in the mid range in some songs you will notice that the vocals are suppressed especially when you re not playing them on high volume this turns me off greatly the sound is punchy overall and mostly enjoyable if you are not very nitpicky but feel the logitech x produces relatively better quality sound friend of mine has it so know this firsthand if you don need mic definitely go for logitech x otherwise this one should do alright 
good look quality also good shape also good beat also good portable satisfaid
audio volumes reduced after months don buy this product
bought this speaker with so much of expectation based on positive reviews but fully shocked with its performance sound quality sound quality is good but the volume is very less when compared to similar products the volume is just more than mobile you connect not at all satisfied with the volume bluetooth connectivity not an issue connected seamlessly 
not satisfied bass level is not interesting 
the speaker is not pleasant to listen with high base music apart from this it is wooowww 
sound quality is good
high priced other speakers with higher output and higher capacity battery
gud
amazon can hadle yhe load at times of big sales 
good compact
good but can get better sound with philips wt with same price
got it from frind good sound effect but less battery time you can listen songs per charge for this price its totally worth itq
it excellent but parking was very poor 
only we give money for nsme of the company jbl sound was not satisfied
very high cost me sale ho rha hai mne purchase kie hai pcs 
awesome sound quality no question 
the sound is not good so m not satisfied with it please return it to sender and please refund the amount into my b c 
bass quality is not as good as was expecting 
sound of this product is not well 
decent
yes it ok for this kind of size but could be cheaper after hearing the sound quality 
review on would say this is ok kinda product sound is good however you cannot hear the instruments used only vocal is heard prominently checked this with portronics sound pot bluetooth speaker and found portronics better with clear and crisp voice
ok
i bought this product recently and here are my findings the sound quality is excellent that even at full volume the quality is good see there is problem while connecting with bluetooth not often but sometimes the music stops playing the media player gets hanged and sound turns off would suggest you to use an aux cable which is making things smooth don prefer bluetooth always will get back with an updated review after few weeks or months to confirm the product is original and worthy to buy 
easy to carry tiny box here and there as per your wish to hear good music and else thanks for this funny toy
awesome product go for it without any if but 
i like the material quality but sound quality doesn live up to my expectations probably because of the product small size it too small for great sound quality otherwise overall it okayish 
sound quality is amazing
missing treble and bass control voice clarity good 
it worked fine for only month always handled the product very carefully but stopped working 
sound quality is so nice but picture shown on amazon and in real is so different e product is very small than showing picture 
i have ordered two speakers in which one have received in new packing and another have received in old packing which is seems that it used speakers
after using for month now feel the sound is decent not loud enough for large rooms ideal for hostel room bass is decent but for me it wasn satisfactory cosidering the price its okay somebody who has heard jbl flip would surely have less liking for this product pocket sized you can carry it anywhere 
nice
good quality in this sound 
my previous experience is with several logitech units lee jabra also bought logitech x for few days before this got this on sale for less than bought it based on glowing reviews not very impressed not very loud and disconnects from the phone after just minutes of inactivity one has to physically go to the unit and press the power button to reconnect so whilst it is wireless it not convenient the x was louder and more convenient jabra had the best sound but the rubberised body started falling apart after months and battery backup reduced too lee there best but sound of logitech and jabra better was surprised at its small size but the sound is correspondingly less no wow factor like logitech or jabra 
sound quality better and battery long yime
worst experience why people gave stars was cheated with these ratings sound base is not good satisfied delivery is on time 
hi used the product for around months and then it stopped working the overall sound effect is good and loud enough in an average sized room but dont expect dolby or bass effect but definitly loud enough battery backup is really good however bluetooth connectivity sometime may disrupt is the device is taken away or moved too much but that can be ignored and doesnt cause much of problem for five months the device was working perfectly fine and was the hero for being the owner of such cool portable device but all of sudden the device dint get switched on and would not get charged contacted the jbl service center as the product was still with in warranty period but they refused to recognize my warranty saying that its not from an authorized dealer then contacted amazon as well as the seller amazon was prompt enough to respond to my query as compared to the seller the seller is still busy gathering details of the product like serial number and all that too they responded after days of my query on contrary amazon quickly recognized my issue and raised request for refund after days of the complaint registry they arranged for pick up and refunded the money would advice when buy this product check the authority of the seller as that where the warranty comes into play as far as amazon is concerned they were superb outstanding in delivery as well as picking the product up the seller bought is from appears as lifestyles storefront or modcameras on the bill 
amazing sounds quality and great product worth buying for portable usage 
ok
toady got delivered and when put the sound at the sound starts to fade selling duplicate product
it just stop emitting audio bought it only months back
worse product have ever bought don even give thought to by it it doesn worth penny
sound quality is very good but less volume and no bass
though useful in inferior to moderate sound quality output sound is like mono not enough for music and quality sound lovers
its good product charging last good volume can be heard till mtrs clearly will suggest for indoor not great for outdoor
i purchased this rs now its rate is rs its not worth of its too small also only it is excellent by looks 
ok
nice one expected little different bt it does nt seem to be overall its good 
nice quality
not good as per expectations bass level vry low no feel come waste of money yr go for blaupnkt bt 
it stoped working within days had bought this product for my anniversary program but on nd it stopped working am not even getting any service centre near by me very bad experiences with job 
product is good but price is not good
sound quality is good 
it a nice product with good bass but only support bluetooth can use your memory cards or other forms 
not so loud not so less volume sufficient for person or two to listen songs in room not that loud to dance in home party then you better need big speakers with full base 
best for surrounding sound but zero base stereo is ultimate metres range is perfect it controls siri
it a good product 
your product is super bakvass sabko mamu banabna bhandh karo
the speaker is too small to be able to produce adequately loud and impressive sound ouput wasn happy with the same and had to return it keeping this apart the product looks great 
frequest bluetooth disconnects and audio quality reduced after two months of usage
good product
if you are more oriented towards bass then go for sony xbs series speakers 
nice
the sound is not as expected becoz had buyed it earlier also and that has very good sound but this don have quality of sound is also not desirable
connection disconnects after mins during ideal time 
not loud or crisp sound as reviewed by few forget about conversations with bluetooth pairing with ur phone overall medium rating will use it more to give good picture after months 
the loudness depends on your source if your source is very good the amplification is awesome otherwise it is average it fine if you are in small enclosure but not sufficient for normal sized room 
nice
bus name hai or kuch ni iski actual mrp rs honi chaiye wale speaker jitna sound hai iska

jbl go jblgoteal portable wireless bluetooth speaker with mic teal where is the mic haven received the mic with speaker 
awesome
nice quality
good speaker sound is really good but the problem is it works only hr min in full charge and jbl claims that it will work for hour it did not work for me if don have problem with battery then definitely go for it or else leave it but what is the use of putting it in charging and playing music it a bluetooth speaker it is useful for travelling but while travelling in bike where will get the charger after hrs also asked the question related to battery and got the reply that it a mini speaker hence hrs is good for its battery so why it is mentioned that it will work for hrs am going to return this bcz same capacity of speaker will get by philips which is half of the price of jbl one more thing calling function is good in this but do you do think that will use this device always for calling it a genuine review if want to verify plz check in frequently asked questions 
i feel hp bluetooth speaker is much better than this which have used before jbl have been using this for past one year battery life hp is much better than jbl bluetooth connection both are same sound and quality go with hp portability jbl is good since it is rectangular shape where hp is cylindrical
good but expected more from jbl the audio quality could have been better 
not met the expected quality may be it was defective piece also had chance to listen to the sound quality of philips model btb bluetooth speaker comparatively philips was better it was disappointment to me since was expecting much from jbl read all good reviews and decided to go for it have placed replacement order lets hope should get good one next time 
battery back up bekaar hai leke pacta raha hoo

nice but mi is giving very gud one in this range mic is not good enough my frnds told me ur voice is not gud when use this
the product is good considering the price point at which it is available but the sound quality could still have been little better
jbl sound quality is good and as per the size it is working fine battery is also good but you will not get wow experience 
nice sound surround over priced 
good product better battery backup 
money worth 
sound quality
the sound quality is good but it stopped working just after few weeks of purchase 
pretty okayish most importantly got an open box and hence suspect it might be returned item star went there the other star went for the fact that when put full volume it cracks little was expecting wow product from the reviews its as said an okayish product 
not worthy
working satisfied
some what happy with this product
sound quality is very poor need to improve quality not worth in this price
received with faulty mm jack
sound is good with clearty base more sound required this product made in china jbl is american company can tell me how it is possible because on product write as made in china 
sound is good but sound come like hsss this is very bad sound like radio
loud bt mono
ya its ok
not bad but could have been bit more loud build quality is good 
ok product
its good sound quality awsm bt its not enough for one room 
cost is high sound is good
i bought two of these the first one worked perfectly but the second one is faulty it turns off automatically and randomly with no warning sometimes fails to charge and it will never charge fully really wish there was way to get it replaced but there isn so if you decide to spend your money on this just know you might not be as lucky as the people posting the good reviews 
the performance has negative graph sound is good but the bluetooth strength is very low music gets disrupted if any thing comes between the source and the device it sometimes gives hard time to connect to another device if already connected to one device promising things are pocket friendly sound is adequately loud you can receive calls too but better alternatives are available in the market 
gud
i got anker soundcore on aliexpress by their offical siye on same rate of rupees and can check its specifications much better than thi s
excelent product sound battery material every thing is gud value for product choose red colour it looks dashing
good product at reasonable price nice sound especially the bass bass is good 
like got this great brand at very good discount dislike even at the highest value level the sound can only be heared from close distanne cracking also at this level sounds starts to crack overall does the basic and immediate job of sound amplification by taking the sound to next level only buy it at great deal not worth the mrp 
good sound quality for the price range some other brands give much better feature for the same price and quality
every thing is good interms of sound but in terms of charging is worst because got the product like that when try to charge by usb the connection is getting lost the indicator of charging light become off after few minutes of plugin eventhough tried different usb cable also but the result is same be catious wn purchase the product cross check charging first because that is the fuel for that 
aamtaur per best products
arrived today and for the rs it has some very decent bass for its size it keeps loosing its bluetooth connection
i am writing this review after one day usage looks wise not good looking like old radio battery back is very poor sound quality is good but there no base quality which is disappointed me if your budget is low and don want extra bass then pretty good deal otherwise go for other brands don expect much in this budget 
its nice product but sound quality os npt good enough
i received nd quality product 
super
sound quality is good
just fabulous as expected from jbl extremly happy
ok
not worth buying 
sound quality is good but not loud does not meet my expectations connectivity with android phones is good but facing connectivity issue with dell and acer laptops windows can use for voice calls as it has built in mic compatible with smartphones 
good sound quality
hi buy this product this is good product nice sound quality
i received the product today and after testing found that it has no bass at all there is some noise also with some disturbances and it is meant for only single room no loud sound 
speaker is nice and sound also but it very small as per image shown and price also high
very small in size only watt sound strength 
vocals come out like it coming from defected low quality speaker highly unsatisfied with product battery life is good 
mono quality
crisp sound poor bass not really loud but still decent for that price and size 
my philips bluetooth speaker was not working and hence looking out for different brand which will fulfill my basic requirement such as small size good descent output if not the best and ease in handling this speaker fulfilled all my basic requirements 
like clarity of sound and loud ness don expect dolby atmos features it just amplifies the sound 
its very nice suberb material quality
no features and no accessories not worth battery backup is not good
bakwas product isse better phillips h
superb
hey there it a decent product at first ordered it but one of my friends had it and decided to cancel the order went for the portonics pqr and its great purchase over these and can assure of that but the decision is yours
the sound quality is fine the speaker works just as an ampilifier for the sound nothing more than that the sound limit it reaches is low also there is no bass at all in the speakers which is basic thing reached the return time limit else would have returned it also you cannot know the level of sound anywhere 
amazon puts product image so enlarged so that when receive ur stuff get surprised since it looks so small in size and shape 
audio is good but price is high there are other products like logitech x available at cheaper price and produce better sound
bass overpowers the sound quality rest it good 
sound quality is good
the speakers are nice but the battery life diminishes to mins after months of using so can really use without constant power supply
good product
it kinda cute but sound is not up to the mark 
amazing product
easy to use and is good for passive listening to the songs if you are an audiophile this may dissappoint you it is good buy for the price no hassel connectivity via blue tooth decent volume of sound while listening in room 
jbl super speaker and punching sound super very nice product
pricing me chutiya bana rahe hai yeh log koi offer wagerah nahi hai 
nice handy bluetooth speaker with better sound quality 
it good
good sound quality
not much satisfied compare with boat 
 packing was not gud bass sound of this speaker really gud but the bluetooth connection is really weak sound breaks so frequently need to keep ur phone really close fr songs to play why do they call it bluetooth speaker they should just give cable to attach with the mobile disappointed rs in drain
sound quality is not good when loud
okay so just received my speaker and its very loud and clear and the best available in the market for this price only thing didn like about this speaker is that think have received an used product but it working properly would have given it full stars but am not happy bcoz have received an used product 
good sound like it wish could reduce the bass though 
very loud sound but basss is 
ok if you are buying for yourself then it is good it is portable which like most problems you can change songs from speaker as there is no button for changing song and the usb cable is very very short otherwise it is good
ok sound quality good build quality better to go in for logitech x which is available for cheaper price and better sound 
its ok ok product things need to mention that it has single side speaker grill not both 
ok for small room genuine review
battery life not good rest is fine
i have bought jbl bluetooth speakers earlier as well however the previous one was higher version costing thrice than this but this one is nothing in front of that ii bought this reading reviews of other people that it has great sound but now realize that those reviews were from inexperienced people if you wanna really feel the power go for higher version have the cylindrical one which costed approx rs but it is still working great even after years 
ok
sound is not as we expected rest quality is ok
in this price great product
jbl wireless unit is really very useful and value for money in it category it gives me the luxury of listening to music from my mobile phone anytime and the sound is of good quality no distortions even at high decibel volume yes ultimately good buy 
bluetooth loses connectivity very frequently and causes break in music which is bit annoying otherwise sound quality is good enough and just the decent volume for such small speaker 
sound kam hai expections se
